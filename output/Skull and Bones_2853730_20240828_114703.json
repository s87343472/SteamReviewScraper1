Uplay requires its own activation key from you and if you own the premium edition (could be true of the other versions but I do not know) you will receive a dlc to your account under purchase history BUT no way to access that key yourself for uplay. Thanks Ubisoft very cool.\n\nSmall edit. It counts the uplay launcher as time played if anyone is wondering.\n\nEdit for the dev- Not only did I do all the things you suggested I also opened a ticket with customer service providing my logs from ubi connect and my steam purchase history. I double checked that my ubi account was connected to this steam account and let ubisoft connect have admin rights which I'm almost glad isn't the solution. I also uninstalled ubisoft connect and reinstalled just in case.\n\nWell I found the issue. I had to reinstall ubisoft connect a second time AND THEN clear the Ubisoft connect cache. Brilliant software.\n\nFinal edit. I did end up requesting a refund on the game due to it simply not being good and for some reason the steam overlay coming up makes my controller work incorrectly. Steam denied for my hours being to high which most of them at this point being my fighting with uplay (it's the same thing get over it). Save yourself the trouble of buying this schlock.",

I'm very disappointed, to be honest. Considering this is supposed to be a Triple-A title from a multi-million dollar company like Ubisoft and you can't even get in to play? There should be an option to opt out of multiplayer completely from the beginning until they can fix matchmaking, but there isn't.

Wouldn't spend money on it, nor buy it for no more than 30 bucks or less just because of Ubisoft alone.\n\nThe Storyline is about as interesting as watching cake bake in an oven, but not enough for me to simply go through each cutscene. Your word choices DO NOT matter, the outcome is the same no matter what.\n\nThis is an always online game, so of course it plays like a mobile arcade game, which is pretty lazy for how many titles Ubisoft has to offer. If you like Ship Combat games, I suppose this is a good game for them. There is no on the ground combat, or Ship-Boarding combat AT ALL. If that is what you were looking for, avoid this game like the plague.\n\nOverall, this game is not a total failure in regards of making a game, but when it comes to comparing the previous titles with greater ship combat and aspects (AC III, AC IV:Black Flag), it falls short on expectations so much that I could hardly recommend this game for anyone, especially at full price.",

        "content": "Posted: August 27\n《碧海黑帆》是育碧开发的一款主打海战与海盗扮演体验的角色扮演游戏，游戏中玩家需要扮演一名海盗在印度洋与其他玩家合作或者对抗，并通过完成各种地标活动获取各式各样的资源与养成素材。\n\n《碧海黑帆》项目立项已久，并且育碧也投入了很多资源进行宣发，可是游戏却一而再再而三的跳票足足七次之多，上一个这样跳票的游戏还是幻之游戏《丝之歌》\n\n欢迎关注网易UU鉴赏家培养计划\n关注UU加速器VX公众号，回复“steam”，获得专属玩家群邀请。\n\n终于今年二月《碧海黑帆》登陆了育碧自家平台，并于今年八月登录了steam。\n\n\n在游戏内容与游玩体验方面，在游戏发售后不久，口碑就已经被爆破了，而实际游玩后，我也只能说《碧海黑帆》只能是的《盗贼之海》的代餐，而且是劣质的那种。\n\n首先说说《碧海黑帆》，这款游戏我认为绝对是育碧寄予厚望的项目，首先在好多年前育碧就想做属于自己的海盗游戏。\n\n当年《刺客信条4》大火，而游戏中的海战内容与海盗文化的浪漫着实让玩家为之着迷，于是不久后育碧就公布了一款脱胎于《AC4》的移动端海战游戏，我记得当年很多宣传内容都是有意无意的去碰瓷自家的《AC4》\n\n但是这款游戏反向非常一般，没翻起什么风浪，于是这个类型的游戏在育碧这边就完全沉寂了。\n\n直到2022年育碧宣布了《碧海黑帆》项目，而不出所料这款游戏也是脱胎于《AC》，甚至每次宣传都要带上一句：这游戏是做AC海战的制作组主导开发的。\n\n终于到了游戏发售，大家满怀期待的进入游戏，可是游戏的品质的确是存在一些问题。首先说说游戏内容的一些问题。\n\n游戏内容上来说，我们扮演的并不是海盗本身，而是扮演的一艘船，这点可能让很多玩家接受不能，因为据我所知买这款游戏的玩家很大一部分其实是想去体验海盗模拟这一块的。\n\n之后就是游戏的气质，这款游戏确实是育碧气质，一打开就知道是育碧的游戏，因为开放世界里的地标事件实在是让人太熟悉了。\n\n除此以外，其余的游戏内容就凸显了一个内容不足，更具体的说就是野心远远大于实力了。\n\n首先育碧的游戏往往会提供巨量的自定义内容，比如《全境封锁》中那样，提供了巨量的外观内容。\n\n而碧海黑帆也是如此，从船长到船上养的宠物，再到海盗船本身，都有很多的自定义外观，但是这也让玩家直观的体会到了另一个问题：好像舰船和装备(数值养成)这一块有点问题。\n\n首先是船体种类非常少，并且可拥有的船只数量真的不像是一个这个世代正常工作室能设计出来的，到了第一赛季结束后才能拥有十艘船。\n\n之后就是装备的问题，玩这款游戏打开一定义选项后，育碧恨不得让你把这艘船的每一个角落都个性化一番。\n\n但是穿上能装备的涉及到数值强的的就只有三个栏位：装甲，炮台，船体陈设。这就让人很费解了，他明明自定义能做的这么好，从船身到烟花一应俱全，但是他做核心系统的时候却这么敷衍。\n\n之后就是战斗部分了，战斗部分并没有大家期待的相互跳帮海盗混战，有的就只有两艘船摆好姿势互射，看谁先被打沉，这就是脱胎于刺客信条是吗，海战扣出来，然后给刺客要素去掉是吗。\n\n\n从《碧海黑帆》的表现上来说，只能说它是一个平庸的海战游戏，甚至和海盗都不搭边，并且不是一款合格的育碧游戏，没有育碧以往游戏的质量。\n\n而且这款游戏也能让人看出育碧工作室协同办公的一些弊端，强力工作室永远是这么强力，但是之前做边角料的工作室永远就只是做做边角料的水平了。",

        "content": "Posted: August 25\n扬帆，乘风破浪，战个痛快！\n《碧海黑帆》终于登录蒸汽平台了，这是一款航海动作角色扮演网游。一款海盗题材的游戏，竟然跟经典潜行动作游戏<刺客信条>有着不可忽略的关系？当年<刺客信条>正统续作<刺客信条4：黑旗>以加勒比海盗时期为背景，不论是这个设定，还是游戏玩法，都深受玩家津津乐道。于是开发商计划将这一部分内容拿出来，单独做个以海盗玩法为主的游戏，也就是我们今日见到的《碧海黑帆》。\n欢迎关注 网易UU鉴赏家培养计划\n\n《碧海黑帆》是款在线角色扮演游戏，当然游戏不止多人游玩内容，游戏也提供了单人游戏环节。由于多人游玩内容，因此需要注意，游玩本作请保持网络畅通。\n\n就个人的游戏体验而言，登录还是比较方便的。以防万一，账号密码一定要记录到笔记本或在线文档，避免忘记。\n\n\n首次打开游戏，会有一段自动播放的赛季动画，该动画制作确实精良，看着也赏心悦目（赶紧截图），只是默认状态下没有（中文）字幕，以至于对这个故事只懂了一部分。\n\n游戏本体的开场的艺术动画，一如既往的保持着该开发商的高水准。其CG的质感和艺术性都非常印象深刻，看着就是一种享受。说实在的，得空时真应该创建一个文件夹专门收录开发商的艺术CG，这是值得的。\n\n\n本作的优化还是令人满意的。该开发商的图形表现一如既往的优秀且稳定，虽然过去多数游戏被玩家们调侃为“罐头”，但是在图形表现上可深得玩家们的认可。\n\n如果只是图形设计、图形质感优秀，有玩家或许会说这也没那么难吧，好像不少开发团队也能办到。可不禁想问一句，在保持着优秀美术的同时，还能把握住游戏性能优化呢？这样的结果当真惊人！特别是开发商在同场景，同视野内容敢于编排大量的（模型）单位的情况下，还能稳稳控制住游戏的优化，属实是谜一样的技术实力。\n\n作为无名小卒，我们的目标就是干出一番事业。游戏最初玩家只有一艘小破船，当然这并不能难到我们，我们生来就是要干大事业的。打造更强的舰船，提升我们的影响力，扩大我们的势力，称霸海域。\n\n本作跟“黑旗”的玩法有些不太一样，感觉更偏向于经营类，将核心体验从“人”转向了“船只”。过去是围绕玩家角色为主，玩家扮演海盗，玩家打造自己的角色，然后会参与船只对战的一系列模拟玩法。本作玩法主要是围绕打造舰队出发（角色环节的权重要低一些），在这个过程中会有其它的游戏内容，例如：执行任务、海域探索、特别事件、货物贸易和海战等玩法。\n\n不过作为主打体验海战的游戏，如果依旧以角色打造为核心，难免与海战主题有些维和，要知道这一次玩家想体验的是海洋战斗。那么如何强化海战的体验，必然是设计最优先的考量，当前游戏内容围绕打造舰队，体验海战的玩法就是很好的出发点。\n\n其实这两者的核心体验都没变，只是所处的视角的变了。“黑旗”的核心体验是款动作冒险游戏，海战掠夺只是所有内容中的一个环节；碧海黑帆的核心体验则是体验开放世界海战的，海盗们的目的无疑是让自己的舰队更强大（能够更好的掠夺别人），所以打造更好舰队的这这种思路没什么大问题。如果真要做成一款纯粹的“海盗模拟器”，那多少有些无聊，对于一些玩家而言，可能还会觉得有些过火了。\n\n设计思路合理，并不表示在落实层面是完美的。本作不论想设计何种海盗体验，在海战的体验环节，一定是重中之重。遗憾本作在海洋对战环节，还是简化了些，其中一些细节不足，这也是前面为什么说本作更偏经营游戏的原因之一。像对于船只的控制，船只对战的模拟都稍微过于娱乐化了一些。而且在海洋冒险环节，最令人热血沸腾的登船战斗环节没有（一段登船动画后直接结算奖励），以及探索体验在后续同质化明显。\n\n游戏中的PVP机制，让我想起了2000年初的网游设计思路。玩家可以自行打开或关闭PVP，开启PVP旗帜后，玩家之间可以相互掠夺，玩家默认处于一种可被其他玩家伤害的状态，当然玩家也可以伤害别人。这个设计整体是合理的，玩法不在新旧，在于合适就好。\n\n如果在海战环节的模拟更加细节一些，个人对其的推荐度应该会更高一层。当前的游戏内容量是足够的，更何况还有大量赛季内容可供游玩。\n\n最后感谢各位冒险者的阅读！",

I mean, really—how do you go from the masterpiece that was Black Flag to this soggy biscuit of a game? It's like expecting a fine rum and getting watered-down grog instead.\n\nI barely survived the opening mission before I had to abandon ship. Naval warfare? More like a cartoonish water balloon fight! Cannons firing like machine guns? Ships doing donuts on the ocean with zero wind mechanics? Even SpongeBob's watery escapades have more realistic naval action!\n\nAnd let’s talk about those graphics—if this game had a face, it would be stuck in the awkward teenage years of the mid-2000s. The textures look like they were plundered from Davy Jones very own bilge tanks, and no amount of \"ray-tracing\" is going to polish this barnacle-encrusted mess. I’ve played mobile games with better visuals and more authentic pirate action!\n\nThen, for absolutely no reason whatsoever, I was kicked from the server! Not disconnected, mind you—actually kicked! It’s like the game itself realized how bad it was and did me a favor by tossing me overboard. So thanks for that I guess.\n\nIn short, if you're looking for a swashbuckling adventure, this ain't it, matey. Save your doubloons and sail far, far away from this one. Black Flag set the bar high—this game just walked the plank.\n\nTime for me to go grovel to the steamy pirate overlord and beg for my doubloons back!",

Decent grind for ships, entertaining mechanics, and good/fun selection of ship weapons for different play styles.\n\nWhat this game is being compared to and what I compared it to is Sea of thieves. This game is not trying to be a pirating sim, where you have to manually control key aspects of the ship and combat of real pirating(?), instead you ARE the ship. If you want to compare it to a game, I would compare it to World of Warships. This game so far is just a naval combat game that has strong arcade elements just like WoW. In order for it to be full price, they should add FPS elements with personal weapons and abilities to grind for also.\n\nDepending on how old you are, this game reminds me of Pirates of the Caribbean Online which was F2P with a subscription wall. If they can replicate the decent story POCO had (which currently is generic pirate story I spam click through), actual ground maps to explore, FPS elements, gun rarity, sword rarities, abilities your character had, and GROUND world events (Ex: Jolly Roger would invade an island and the server had to defend it on land), i'd happily pay full price.",

Even Assassins Creed 4, the game that this was inspired by, had far more interesting ship combat that was arcade like but still had weight to it.\n\nBeing able to turn on the spot to fire front cannons then any other cannons after they reload is a bit silly. Ships having a Stamina bar is crazy. And using items on the spot like a traditional rpg makes no sense to me.\n\nAs I was not having fun with the first hour of the game at all I decided to refund it. I did not experience the mid to late game content like the boss battles or monster fights. But I imagine its more of the same with different cannons.\n\nIm certain Ubisoft will stick to this game for at least another few years as long it makes even a little bit of money for them, but I don't think I would ever consider trying this game again unless some fundamental changes were made to how combat and sailing works.",

Ну формально главный квест есть. Но назвать происходящее сюжетом язык не повернется\nЧтобы разобраться в местной системе понадобится время. У меня уже через час был забит инвентарь, но я не понимаю, что относится к крафту, а чем можно барыжить. Что продать, а что оставить. Блт я даже не понял как крафтить в этой игре что-либо\n\n\n\n\nПо оптимизации всё норм. R5 5500+4060. На 1080р максимальные настройки с длсс в каааачественном пресете. Ни одного вылета не было. Пару раз в хабе текстуры земли мерцали ну и хер бы с ними.\n\nПочему игре я поставил палец вверх? Не обращайте внимания, я люблю дрочильни, и вот конкретно сами бои на кораблях выполнены неплохо. Я тут залетел в коопную миссию, в которой оказался один, и в одно лицо, маневрируя, развалил босса, который тараном вырубал моему корыту половину хп. Ну блт неплохо сделано.\nУчитывайте, что игра про гринд ради гринда. Есть батлпасс какой-то там я хз, мне это не интересно, я этого не понимаю.\n\nЯ банально хочу упороться и продвинуться дальше, может быть игра на каком-то этапе раскроется как старфилд, а может быть меня ждет финальная миссия как в смуте. За рубас с копейками по 60% скидке - сойдет, если поплавать и погриндить охота. Но это не сюжетное приключение, это дрочильня. Даже в дивижке был какой-то более менее вменяемый движ. Тут пока я этого не замечаю.\n\nВсем добра, бутылку рома и попутного ветра в задницу",

And for anyone into sailing ships in a very arcady way, yet nice graphics and decent combat, this maybe a fun game for you.\n\nThe bad; It lacks depth, but that's not to say there isn't progression that can be fun for the first 20 or 30 hours. After that, you're doing the same stuff over again to slowly grind materials to get the last little stats and bonuses out of your ships.\n\nEnd Game or lack thereof is also a disappointment. It's not to say there isn't one. But what you have is a grindy slow paced logistics management system. It's been made easier in Season 2. But it doesn't change how slow and honestly boring the gameplay is.\nThere is hard bosses to kill, over and over again for chests and it can be fun, even more so in a group of players. Just after doing the same 10 or so boss ships becomes boring after awhile.\n\nSo after that, why would I ever recommend this game? And that is a good question. I find enjoyment here, and I look forward to what may come to the game down the road.\nThe Devs have been fairly responsive over the last 6 months, taking our feedback and helping things get better. With the launch of Season 3, I can feel the games UI is far better now for PC players. When navigating or using items, it feels less like a console port.\n\nThe map is large, but with fast travel it becomes smaller quick. And we've had no increase in map size since launch. We also lack Large class of ships, which is a major bummer.\nDevs say they are working on them, But until we can have a Corvette or Frigate I don't think players will be happy.\n\nThis is mostly a PVE game, with a opt in choice for open world PVP. However servers are small, and PVP activities aren't very exciting.\nSo if you enjoy ships, and can play with friends or a group, I do think you'll have some fun here for a discount. With hope that Devs will keep listening to feedback and give us the stuff players are wanting.\n\nIt's not a AAAA game, nor is it a AAA game. But it's not a \"bad\" game.",

Turned out that it was required that in order to do either of those things I had to install 3 sets of cannons on my Cutter ship. Had to be cannons, the different types of projectiles I added did not count at all. There was nothing that stated that I had to layout my Cutter ship that way to get these customisations, it happened out of pure chance and time.\n\nThe game play is fine. It's nothing special at all, just very basic: drive ship, aim gun, shoot gun. The map is small, character movement looks and feels dodgy and you can't jump. The icons on the map do not tell you what things they are icons for they are just small icons on a map.\n\nThere are game-breaking bugs that they clearly do not care about. While doing coop, my friend and I were battling an enemy group of ships then at the same time we both were flashed with the \"out of bounds\" message and then our crews revolted. We were not out of bound at all, we were to the west of the Spice Islands. Upon respawning, my ship wreckage was placed out of bounds, thousands of metres from where I had originally been overthrown. Because of this I was unable to get hours of loot back. Same thing happened to my friend. Refund and support request was denied.\n\nThis game is not worth the money it costs to buy it. You will get bored of it within hours or you will deal with a game-breaking bug and lose your progress like my friend and I did.\n\nDo not buy.",

        "content": "Posted: August 24\nИзначально я планировал отыграть хотя бы два часа, прежде чем писать обзор, но не думаю, что за дополнительное время однообразный и неинтересный геймплей каким-либо образом изменится.\n\nЗа этот час, что я провел в игре, я выполнил несколько квестов: поплыви туда, потопи пару кораблей, вернись, сдай квест. Затем отправляйся в другое место, снова потопи те же самые корабли и вернись обратно, чтобы взять ещё один такой же квест. Управление кораблём — отдельная тема. Оно максимально скучное и однокнопочное, вес корабля вообще не ощущается. Только и ждёшь, пока выносливость корабля (что, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, выносливость корабля?) восстановится, чтобы продолжить долбить на W и побыстрее доплыть, чтобы сдать квест и поскорее взять абсолютно идентичный, и опять долбить кнопку. А, и ещё можно лутать кокосы прямо из-за штурвала корабля, проплывая мимо острова. Я как преданный фанат Папича (амбассадора реализма) очень негодую от такого нереалистичного геймплея.\n\nКроме того, игра в целом оставляет ощущение скучного и неинтересного кала, даже за этот скромный мною час, проведённый в ней, с примитивными, тупейшими катсценами, в том числе и катсценами абордажа (да, абордаж в этой игре — это просто катсцена, а не что-то наподобие, хотя бы как в AC Black Flag). Очень жаль, что игра на релизе выглядит так, особенно учитывая, сколько времени она находилась в разработке. Я за ней очень долго следил, но чем больше новостей о ней появлялось, тем сильнее становилось понятно, что получится на релизе. Обидно, что большинство из нас оказались не в состоянии прикоснуться к продукту такого уровня — человечество пока не готово потреблять игры AAAA-класса от Ubisoft, как бы они усердно ни толкали индустрию вперёд своими \"произведениями\" последние годы.\n\nИскренне очень жаль, что игра на релизе выглядит вот так. Пиратский сэттинг сам по себе очень интересный и захватывающий, но здесь, к сожалению, это не тот случай.",

No way to delete, remake or start a new game. I get that the game is primarily you in the ship doing sea battles, as there is no ground-side combat, but come on.

Everything that isn't sailing and combat is cumbersome and puts me off the thought of booting it back up.\n\nThe menu designs are really clunky and irritating\nYou can't track multiple missions or mission objectives at once\nIf you're just trying to locate a public event on the map there's a good chance you'll accidentally pay silver to fast-travel to it because the fast travel button is the same as the scroll map button.\nAcquiring blueprints for new ships and weapons is a hassle and an agonizingly slow drip-feed. The blueprints themselves are scattered around the world and rank-gated to purchase.\nThe voice acting is ok, but I just wish NPCs would talk less. I don't need to hear the raw material refiner's life story. I don't need to listen to the carpenter wax poetic about logs. You can skip a line at a time, but if you just want to get back to blasting ships, you have to slam the spacebar 20-30 times to get the next quest.\nCharacter animations are somehow both too stiff and too fluid at the same time\n\nSpyglass scouting is neat\nShips look and handle great, behind the captain camera feels great.\nCannons and torpedoes are fun to shoot.\nThis makes me want a new SMP more than it makes me want to continue playing.\n\nGlad I didn't buy this at full price.",

The immersion was lost after about 2 hours of gameplay; This was mainly due to shock of my face realizing the size of the playable map. Combat difficulty was plain dumb, all depends on the level of your ship limiting challenging encounters with tougher bosses or captains. No. The game insists on collecting resources, taking the time to return to port to craft, once you complete that, just ram your ship with the appropiate level you currently are at, regardless of the modifications you did to your ship.. Its just taking time from you is the exact purpose of this game.\n\nCons:\n- Slow-paced\n- Inability to physically plunder towns -- enjoy the vid, especially the part where the NPC flings the bottles around... like bruh. Dont do that.\n- In-person movement, or even just the gameplay where you spend 1/3 of your time on land. Horrible controls, horrible camera, awkward and cringy conversation that everyone has something the ♥♥♥♥ to say to you.\n- Grind 4 big ship...\n\nPros:\n- $24 -- The only reason why I got this game. In reality, should cost $15. AAAA my ass",

        "content": "Posted: August 23\nMy First Hour in Skull and Bones\n\nUpon clicking play, I waited around 5 minutes for the third-party Ubisoft launcher to load and update. Then I had to sign in, and it asked for a product key. After canceling out of that menu, I had to click play again. This time, the game launched after BattleEye loaded. I loaded into the game quickly after that, only to be met with an unskippable cutscene. I then had to agree to a \"play nice, play fair, play safe\" prompt, or else I couldn't play.\n\nI clicked play on the main menu and had to sit through another unskippable cutscene. I was having a somewhat good time destroying the small enemy ships, but then I ran into the bigger boss ship that was as spongy as a Division boss. I got 6 minutes of gameplay before another unskippable cutscene. Then I got the longest loading screen yet, which led to another cutscene. During this tutorial phase, pausing did not actually pause the game, but if you paused during a cutscene, that cutscene would pause.\n\nAfter that 4 and a half minute cutscene, I got to a character creator that was less interesting than the Division’s. Don’t worry, you can put facial hair on your female character (icky). At least I could skip the dialogue now. When I entered the social hub, the players running around were super buggy—floating and flying all over the place.\n\nAfter running around and skipping dialogue for about 6 minutes, I finally got to edit my ship after another loading screen.\n\nYou can't name your ship \"c0ck_cruncher,\" \"weiner_eater,\" or \"UbiRichardRider.\" \"Muncher\" is a banned word in general. I settled for \"Richard_Sitter.\" I accidentally disembarked three times while trying to sail away and had to wait through agonizing loading screens. I was shocked when I realized my ship had a stamina bar.\n\nI attacked NPC ships and \"boarded\" them, which just triggered a loot-box-esque menu where I could choose what generic items to take. At one point, some dolphins jumped out of the water next to my ship, and I thought it was another ship firing at me—I’m not sure if it was a player, but I sank it anyway. This gave me a wanted level that seemed like it was trying to imitate GTA, but nothing happened, and it just went away after a while.\n\nI then sailed across the sea to a big X on the map, only to find out it was my marker that I didn’t realize I had set, and not treasure.\n\n\nThis game is AAAA in name (and maybe in a graphical sense? I didn’t play with the settings turned up all the way) only.\n\nIt makes sense why they heavily discounted it for its Steam release (where it should have released in the first place). I’m on the fence about refunding it, as I got a bit of dopamine from sinking ships (a single, measly drop of dopamine is all I need in life), although the sinking animation is the exact opposite of Sea of Thieves—lifeless and emotionless. But I wouldn’t pay full price for this game in a million years, let alone consider the premium edition.\n\nPirates: The Legend of Black Kat from 2002 for the Original Xbox and PlayStation 2 is more of a AAAA game than this. Also, if you ever need to contact Ubi support for help with any issue, you’d get better assistance letting your cat lick you clean with its sandpaper tongue.",

        "content": "Posted: August 24\nTämä peli on vaan paska. Tai sitten ehkä ei.\n\nAinoa asia joka tässä pelissä on hyvää, on seilaaminen. Meri on tehty hienosti ja laivalla seilatessa kun sitä katsoo sieltä kapteenin näkökulmasta ruorin takaa, niin siinä on tunnelmaa. Seilaamisesta ja merestä olenkin tykännyt niin paljon, että olen tätä jaksanut pelata.\nNyt kun olen pelannut paljon pidemmälle, on peliin jotenkin innostunut muutenkin. Edelleen moni moni asia kuitenkin vaivaa ja välillä on pakko kysyä, miksi?\n\nLaivataistelu on arcadepaskaa. Boarding ei oikeastaan ole laivanvaltausta vaan enemmänkin sitä että heität tarpeeksi huonolla healtillä olevaan laivaan köydet eli entraushaat niin että saat siitä kiinni, siinä se sitten on.\nVoit lootata laivan, ei miekkailua ei taistelua. Miehistö tuntuu vain luovuttavan samantien.\nVihollislaiva uppoaa aina. Sitä ei voi kaapata esim omaan käyttöön tai myytäväksi. Ainoa ero siinä että ampuu laivan upoksiin tai boardaa sen tuntuu olevan lootin määrä. Tästä herääkin kysymys. Miksi? Miksi ei ole nähty sitä vaivaa joka on nähty monen monen pikku yksityiskohdan hiomiseen ja tehty kunnollista laivan valtausta, samoin kuin kaupungin valtaukseenkin olisi voitu liittää maataistelut musketteineen ja miekkoineen. Seilatessa laivaan on kuitenkin tehty kaikenlaista hienoa, miehistöä puhkeaa laulamaan aika ajoin ja heitä voi pyytääkkin laulamaan. Silloin tällöin merimetso laskeuttuu ohi lentäessää ruorikoneiston päälle jne.\nSiitä olennaisesta asiasta on tehty loppujenlopuksi helvetin tylsää. Sitten kuitenkin on pakko myös myöntää, että suoraviivaisessa ja nopeassa meritaistelussa on myös hyötynsä. Kun pelaat pidemmälle ja olet isommalla laivalla liikenteessä, ei vain jaksa jokaisen pikkupurtilon vuoksi vaivautua. silloin on helpompaa vain ohimennessään ampua täysilaidallisella purtilo upoksiin ja kerätä pikanäppäimellä kelluvat roinat matkaan sen kummemmin edes hidastamatta matkantekoa.\nImmersiota se ei kuitenkaan lisää.\n\nSitten epäolennaiset asiat, kuten maissa liikkuminen, laivan värkkääminen paremmaksi ja kaupankäynti jne. Kaikki valikot ja systeemit on tehty helvetin monimutkaiseksi juuri näissä pelin kannalta epäolennaisissa asioissa. Kaikki pitää graftata itse. Laivakin graftataan niistä roinista mitä olet onnistunut arcade seilauksellasi haalimaan. Kun peliä pelaa pidemmälle, alkaa kaikessa olla jonkinasteista logiikkaa ja järkeä ja huomaa, että peli tekee ihan älyttömän huonon selostuksen pelaajalle siitä mitä mikäkin merkitsee. Koska pelin pelaamisen tyyli on enemmänkin sellainen nopeatempoinen arcade räiskintä kuin roolipelaaminen, on ainakin itsellä myös vain kokoajan kiire johonkin muualle ja moni teksti yms jää sen vuoksi lukematta tarkemmin. Vasta pitkän ajan päästä huomaa, että ahaa, tuota varten pitää tehdä nuin.\n\nVaikka tässä on nyt tullut vähän ristiriitainen kuva pelistä en siltikään katso että sitä voisi suositella. Itse ostin steam alesta ja suosittelen ostamaan tämän vain alennuksesta. ihan kivaakin voi olla, mutta jos se seilaaminen ei ole hauskaa niin unohda kokonaan.\nTähän kun vielä päälle heitetään se että peli on alusta asti ollut buginen eikä sitä vieläkään ole korjattu. (Tämähän on ollut jo vaikka kuinka kauan Bugisoftin omalla kauppapaikalla.)\nEsim. bugi joka estää pelaajia saamasta käyttöönsä ollenkaan mitään kosmetiikkaa kapteenille, miehistölle tai edes laivalle. Jos voit vaihtaa vaatteesi tai koskemiittaa laivallesi niin olet niitä onnekkaita joiden peli ei ole rikki.\nMuitakin melko massiivisia grafiikkabugeja on edelleen. Välianimaatiossa hahmo juo näkymättömästä viinapullosta, eikä siinä mitään muuten mutta tuon kohtauksen kannalta juuri se pullo on ikäänkuin pääosassa.\nLaivan miehistö kiipeilee välillä ihan missä sattuu. Toisaalta se tuo myös huvittavaa vaihtelua merimatkalle kun näkee kaverin laskeutuvan mastosta alas ja sukeltävän pääedellä laivan alle. Ärsyttävämpää on kun laivasi häviää kartalta, etkä tiedä missä olet.\nNämä vain muutamia mainitakseni.",

C'est à peu près comme comparer Ace Combat avec Flight Simulator et pleurer qu'on peut pas faire les même choses.\n\nEn vrai, je me suis plus amusé que sur Sea Of Thieves.\n\nPourquoi ?\nParce que malgré tout, Ubisoft a compris que le JcJ n'était pas obligatoire,\nparce que jouer 7-8h et tout perdre, c'est pas marrant mais frustrant,\nparce que le combat naval, c'est pas se catapulter sur le bateau ennemi et tuer les joueurs en boucle,\nparce que si on voulait jouer à une simulation de manoeuvre de navire, on jouerait à ship simulator,\nparce qu'on a pas de bug qui nous fait catapulter et retomber dans les airs,\nparce qu'on peut faire un jeu sans passer par unreal engine ou unity,\nparce que même si ubisoft est une machine à fric, ils peuvent encore nous surprendre et rajouter du contenu.\n\nY'a certainement plein de choses que j'oublie. Ah, si, Ubisoft ne m'a pas encore insulté, contrairement a Rare.\n\nPour en revenir aux glandus des sites de reviews, arrêtez de faire vos tests à charge et faites le à décharge, si vous étiez honnête, vous auriez également comparé avec Naval Action et Blackwake ou Bucanneer. Le seul point sur lequel je suis d'accord avec ces glandus, c'est que ce jeu n'est pas un AAAA et ne vaut en réalité qu'une 30ène d'euros.\n\nEdit : Je lis d'autres reviews de glandus. Un au pif à mis 3/10 au jeu parce que l'histoire est bof et le jeu possède des quêtes fedex. Je fais le feed de ce garçon : 9/10 pouor WoW. L'histoire est mieux et y'a moins de quête fedex dans WoW ? Première nouvelle.\n\nJ'en prends une autre : Je préfère Sea Of Thieves, y'a pas de contenu dans Skull & Bones. (Non, y'a juste plus de 10 bateaux, contrairement aux trois de SoT, des canons différents en fonction de ce que tu préfères. C'est les missions qu'il te manque ? Va chasser ou piller une route marchande dans Sea Of Thieves. Ah pardon, tu peux pas, ça n'existe pas.)\n\nAllez, pour le fun, j'en prends une troisième (J'aime me faire du mal) : Y'a que Sea Of Thieves avec lequel ce jeu est comparable. On l'a déjà dit plus haut, y'a Naval Action, Blackwake, ... Y'a même un remake un peu foireux de Sea Dogs (même si j'adore ce jeu.).\n\nJ'adore taper sur ubisoft quand ils font n'importe quoi. Je suis le premier à leur démolir la tronche, mais là, le seul argument qui est valable c'est : votre jeu est techniquement dépassé et ne vaut pas plus de 30€. C'est tout.",

And than shoot them to loot them.\n\nQuests are kind enough to tell you where to find ships that carry items you need, and honestly the trade route system in this game is pretty fun. Want a certain type of resource; just sail its trade route and plunder away. Or follow it all the way to its source town, and plunder it from there. Or both. You're a Pirate, if the random crowd of people who go from making fun of you to cheering your name after 2 minutes are to be believed.\n\nThe problem is they put a lot of (needless) effort into also making it look good, thus the bloated price tag. The pure gameplay loop itself I would pay $30 for now adays, which is the price I would happily pay for a good high quality indie game in this day and age.

I have attempted to contact Ubisoft support prior regarding this issue however none of the solutions provided were of help and it took a long time for them to respond to my message, so I barely played any for the month of subscription that I had with Ubisoft+.\n\nI enjoyed the game while it works but given how many issues and crashes to my PC it caused I cannot recommend it for anyone who run into issues with it, but if your system is able to support it then yes it is a good enough game.",

Id call it a cozy game for boys. maybe in the same vein of like truck simulator or something similar.\n\nthe systems are not confusing exactly but they are not laid out well at all, mission structure takes far longer than it needs to to really make sense, grinding items is a bit silly for what they are. sailing has some nuance to it but it really boils down to pretty simplistic movements but with some skill to it at a times. sometimes the game pops off most of the time its just relaxing really.\n\nits a good game to be in discord watching movies, i dunno if its much more than that at the moment. i dont hate it, i recommend it at $20 but the first 3 hours were a bit of a slog they maybe better now but im not totally sure i originally played them in the pre release 10hr trial before the game launched. i hadnt played it again till it hit steam in season 3.\n\none big thing is the Fly by island craft minigames seem to be gone which is fantastic after the second or third one you never want to do them again.\n\nfree customization is good for what it is, i find it hard to want to spend money on the game though outside of the initial purchase, as a live service i find it hard to see how it continues for a long time without major purchases so im not sure its longevity. but for whats here it isnt bad,\n\nits is by no stretch aaaa or even aaa. but there is some fun ship combat holding it all together.",

La historia no es su fuerte y en general lo que podáis leer por ahí.\n\nPero la jugabilidad y el apartado técnico, geniales. Es súper divertido navegar y piratear.

        "content": "Posted: August 23\nI wanted to leave a review for real people who love pirates who are curious about this game. This will be longish as there's a lot of thoughts and misconceptions to debunk on this game.\n\nI will just say in summary now, this game is awesome, and getting better by the season and most of its hate is unwarranted and frankly, weird. I'm not sure why this game has garnered the weirdo incel crybaby crowd that stalks it insulting it continuously but the game is actually really really good. Keep reading for deeper thoughts.\n\n1. This is not an assassins creed game. Your captain is not your main character, sure you can dress him up, but you won't be swashbuckling with a sword and pistol against other captains. It was also never advertised to be that - Most of this games hate has to do with it not being AC: Black Flag 2, when this was always designed as a new IP with nothing to do with AC. And yes, you are thinking, \"well why are people mad its not Black Flag 2 then?\" I do not know either, people are seriously dumb so I just attribute that as the answer.\n\n2. This game is not a \"crew\" game like Sea of Thieves, you need no help controlling the biggest ships available currently and being fully combat ready, but you can group with up to 2 other captains for scaling difficulty and loot and run as a group of captains, and its encouraged to mix your builds and strengths and weaknesses to compliment each other in this way.\n\n3. The game is not overly difficult for Solo players, you can progress through the entire thing without help after you learn the ropes and mechanics and if you have the skill. Some of the harder bosses are easier of course with other players, but that's easy to accomplish as well as you can ask for help and I've never seen someone not show up.\n\n1. This is an MMO-Lite game, with light class based design and RPG elements. And this is probably the definitive ship combat pirate game. Your ship is 100% your main character, its what you level up by acquiring better gear, its what has a base class built into it and determines your base play style (Healer/Tank/DPS with different perks per ship) You can truly tailor a ship to play how you feel engaging, it be viable and feel rewarding. And be fully customizable down to the type of wheel you use on top of that.\n\n2. This game has very satisfying end game loop of boss grinding for drops and cosmetics mixed with opt in PvP elements and a fully fleshed out Empire building mechanic with ranks and leader board's you can climb with resource generation and management. This gets reset seasonally so the grind to be the top or in the top ranks can start anew.\n\nI honestly love this game, I didn't know if I would and I didn't play it at launch thanks to the review bombing, but Ubisoft Connect had a 6 hour free trial, I purchased it within 2 hours of that trial. The hate and vitriol that follows this game and its dev's has to be AI bots or neck-beards it's truly wild to see people stalk it on X or Reddit just to spew hate, most of which have never even played it.\n\nPlay it or don't but hope to see you all on the high sea's matey!",

It was something fresh over 10 years ago. So Ubisoft thinks, like it always thinks, \"why not take old code and resell it for nostalgia seekers\". So they take a small part of the code, put some new paint on it, and try selling it as a new full AAAA game. And result is like Fallout 76 was when it launched, trying to sell same stuff again and again with minimum effort.\n\nThere is no new real game here, it is only a part of the decade old Assassin's Creed recycled and badly re-painted. World takes 20 hours to explore, it seems at this point, so I'll get one hour per euro value for this purchase. I do like to just sail and look at the battles, then swoop in and take loot of the NPC vs NPC battles left floating. That's the game for me so far and I feel like I still want to continue sailing after 5,5 hours.\n\nAt this point I cannot recommend the game, because I don't feel it has content nor the mechanics to make it worth 60 or even 24 euros. I'll update if I find the content.\n\nFYI: All bad reviews out there are not real. They haven't even played the game really. I unlocked trophies in 5 hours 95% players haven't unlocked. Many do not really try the game or even give it a chance. Bad review, refund and out of sight, out of mind, feeling good for bullying Ubisoft.",

I tried to give this game a chance and play a little despite the issues I was having, it just got boring and quick. Turns out I gave it too long of a chance and couldn't get a refund.\nIf you feel like you just need to waste some money and want to sit there wishing it was Black Flag the whole time.... then this is the game for you. Otherwise don't bother with it.",

Ein Shooter halt. Nicht mehr und auch nicht weniger.\nEin paar Bugs gibt es allerdings. Einmal war mein Schiff, ein zweites Mal nur die Mannschaft geisterhaft dargestellt. Ein Neustart war da nötig um den Fehler zu beheben. Ärgerlicher ist aber das ich in den 22 Stunden mindestens dreimal plötzlich auf der Karte versetzt wurde, nach einem Ladescreen taucht man an ganz anderen ecken der Spielwelt wieder auf.\nEs ist halt ein UAAAAAA Spiel :).\nIch muss leider eine Empfehlung geben weil es nicht ganz schlecht ist und Steam ein Unentschieden nicht vorsieht.",

Had ubisoft+ when the game originally released in feb 2024. here it is august and a little over 40% of its world map is still under fog of war that you cant access. there still are no large sailing ships to work towards. then it becomes either a grind fest of raiding ports, a grind fest of being a businessman controlling ports, or a pvp fest because youre bored out of your skull. the only thing theyve done is put up grind fest after grind fest seasonal activity so you can race your grind to gather that seasons currency to get cosmetics and, IF YOU SPEND MORE MONEY to buy their smugglers pass premium, you MIGHT get one or two things off the premium like a cannon but still mostly just cosmetics. all in all it took me maybe 20 hours of grinding to reach the point where i was in the black market and thats where it becomes a real grindfest. no boarding and swashbuckling your way to victory, no leaping the gunwales and charging into the port on foot to slash and shoot your way to the plunder the town. not a terrible game but if this is what they consider a quad A game i dont think the company will survive. their biggest and best game to date still is Farcry 5.",

        "content": "Posted: August 25\nOkay so... If you know what you're getting into here, you'll probably have a fun enough time with it.\n\nFirst, this is no \"AAAA\" game. The map isn't as big as you'd probably expect, and the overall scope of the game seems rather narrow for such a title. Really... it kinda feels like a decently funded indie game... But it's no No Man's Sky either.\n\nThe whole game, is pirating naval combat. That's like, 99% of what you're going to be doing. Ever played Black Flag? That funny Assassin's Creed game? This game is built on the entire idea of that game's ship combat. But that's really it. It's just ship combat, and occasionally walking around some beach looking for buried treasure.\n\nYou sail around, fight ships from multiple factions, maybe even a sea monster or three, and loot their crap to make more and better crap for yourself, and turn in contracts.\n\nThis game, is going to feel a bit grindy, and it will feel unfair if you don't have the better stuff crafted to increase the level of your ship. That's how this game works. You can't just go in and sink an enemy ship multiple levels higher than you, aka, better equipped.\n\nThere is hunting in the game that's a bit unique from the rest of the stuff, where you get in your little hunting boat and throw spears at animals until they die. You COULD just blast them with cannons on a bigger ship, but then you'd ruin whatever they drop pretty much.\n\nThe game is no Sea of Thieves or anything like that, BUT, there is mechanics in the game for a holy trinity role based system. You have ships that act as tanks, with weapons that can provoke and keep the attention of enemy ships, DPS specializing ships, and even healer type ships, that you can equp with weapons that can be shot at allies to repair their ships.\n\nIt's an interesting concept... And so far I really like it.",

You want to play without spending money? Fine, there's plenty of earnable currency (pieces of eight) that you can use to buy upgrades for your ship and cosmetics.\nThe live service is basically like the Diablo 4 style progression passes, which I don't have a problem with. You want to get the stuff? Spend the money and put the time in to unlock the items. Otherwise your ship will behave just like any other, you just won't have a fancy theme on your ship.\nI put in nearly 20 hours at the time of this review, I think there's lots of content to keep me entertained. Between this and Helldivers, and Diablo 4 I'm fairly entertained.\n\nThe TL;DR: Look, go into it not expecting another amazing Black Flag. It's just pirate ships fighting each other, but it's still fun. Did the game match the hype? No, but honestly what games really DO match the hype? Very few.\nRelax, sit back, have some rum and enjoy blasting Frenchmen with your cannons. You'll enjoy life more that way.",

Hra nabízí odlišný styl než třeba Sea of Thieves a svým zaměřením mi připomíná spíše World of Warships, i když je o něco komplexnější. Máte zde více možností, co se týče lodí a zbraní, což přidává na hloubce a variabilitě.\n\nDoporučuji, abyste si udělali vlastní názor místo toho, abyste hru hned odsoudili na základě názorů v médiích. A pokud se vám hra nebude líbit, vždy je tu možnost vrácení peněz přes Steam, pokud nebudete během prvních dvou hodin spokojeni. Za zkoušku tedy nic nedáte.",

Игра полна багов и крашей. Они не сильно влияют на игровой процесс но качество жизни, сильно портят. Для проекта, который позиционирует себя как АААА игра, это недопустимо.\n3. Абсолютно наплевательское отношение к наполнению мира, копи-паст встречается практически везде.\n4. Квестинг и сюжет - существуют для видимости того, что это есть.\n\nЧего же хорошего есть в этой игре?\n- Визуал приятный\n- Атмосфера пиратского приключения, чувствуется. Немного смущает, что ты пират-рэмбо в одиночку уничтожающий целые морские армии, но спустим на допущения.\n- Если относиться к игре, как к ненапряжной гриндилке в приятной пиратской атмосфере, с покупкой \"по скидке\", то часов 60-80 контента вполне могут доставить вам удовольствие.\n\nКак итог: Это не проект, который надо покупать прямо сейчас. Это не проект, который вас удивит или изменит ваше представление об индустрии. Но поиграть в это можно, это не \"мусор\" это просто \"норм\". Отзыв негативный, только из-за фул прайса и созданного разработчиками \"ожидания АААА проекта\". Это проходняк среднего качества.",

As a good captain with a good crew even in blackwake where you could walk around, 95% of the time you're behind your steering wheel (4% is boarding, 1% is emergency repairs ;) )\nSo I'm not mad about that missing functionality.\nThe price however is way to high, reduce the base price to 50€ and we're talking, I would not have bought it if not for the 60% offer...\nAll in all: A nice game with potential, doesn't deserve 75% of the negative reviews on here... (It isn't a superb game, but it isn't that bad either)",

        "content": "Posted: August 24\nI'll preface this by saying I didn't keep up to date with the development or launch problems of this game, so perhaps I'm coming into the game with a more unbiased opinion of it.\n\nI think it's reasonably fun. It's not AC4, but something else entirely. This game is more akin to some weird love child between World of Warships and something like Euro Truck Simulator 2, bringing the arcade-y naval action of WoWs with the calming (for me at least) monotony that you find in transport (\"commerce\") aspects of ETS2/ATS or Elite Dangerous. The combat isn't particularly difficult, but you can and will die on occasion, especially early on. Most of your time post-Captain Level 10 will be spent running transport missions for illicit goods, hence the comparison to ETS2.\n\nThere's a surprising amount of depth and synergy to the ship weapon setups, though many of the best weapons look to be locked behind the lengthy end-game grind or seasonal battle pass rewards. I've seen complaints about fast travel being sparse, but I don't have too much of an issue with that. Once you've explored the map a fair bit, you'll find more than a few fast travel points to make use of. The only time you're locked out of fast travel is when doing the end-game blockade running missions, which is perfectly reasonable in my opinion. Limping away from a difficult fight and being a fair distance from the nearest port can be frustrating, but I think it's a necessity for difficulty and perfectly thematic.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game actually feels really smooth. I'm running on an older system with a 1080Ti, and on High graphics it's completely stable at 60-70 fps. No hard crashes, but have had the odd map/journal UI buggyness. Nothing game breaking, and far better than what I was led to expect.\n\nIs the game worth $79.99 CAD normally? Definitely not, no. Not when compared to the major releases in that price range of the past couple years.\n\nOn sale for 60% off or more? I'd say so, yes. Just know what kind of game it is and don't expect it to be something it isn't.",

The devs have heard us with our wallets and are making the game player friendly while clinging onto the piratey ocean feel. for example the minigame to loot ships is gone, you can just hold the button and open the screen and get fast enough to loot and scoot. shrug is aight man is aight",

        "content": "Posted: August 23\n《碧海黑帆》在玩法上独树一帜，将海战与船只养成巧妙结合，为玩家打造了一个既充满挑战又极具策略性的海洋世界。游戏中数十种船只各具特色，无论是暴力冲撞还是远程炮击，玩家都能根据自己的战术偏好进行选择，这种高度的自定义和策略性极大地提升了游戏的可玩性。此外，PVP机制的引入更是让游戏充满了变数与激情，玩家可以在广阔的海域中与其他玩家一较高下，体验真正的海盗生活。\n在核心的海战体验上，《碧海黑帆》虽然为玩家提供了丰富的船只和战斗模式，但在细节处理上仍有提升空间。例如，船只的控制感和炮弹的命中反馈可以更加真实和精准，以提升玩家的战斗沉浸感。同时，登船战斗环节的简化也让人略感遗憾，毕竟这一环节在海盗题材游戏中往往能够激发玩家的热血与激情。\n《碧海黑帆》其独特的玩法、丰富的游戏内容以及良好的联机体验仍然使其成为一款值得一试的海战游戏。对于喜欢海战、喜欢挑战的玩家来说，《碧海黑帆》无疑是一个不可多得的选择。未来，如果游戏能够在这些方面进行进一步的优化和完善，相信会吸引更多玩家的加入，成为海战类游戏中的佼佼者。",

Dat haal je er makkelijk uit.\nIs het een AAAA game? Nee. Is het een game voor iedereen? Nee.\nMaar persoonlijk heb ik er gewoon heel veel plezier in. Verstand op 0 en contracten doen om je schip te upgraden om uiteindelijk weer moeilijkere missies te kunnen ondernemen. Het is een typische Ubi game. Maar dat weet je gewoon als je iets koopt van Ubisoft. Het is wel een totale andere ervaring, setting en gameplay en erg leuk met vrienden te spelen.\nZeker met een krat bier en party-snacks erbij :P\n\nDus ja een aanrader als je het nu koop met dikke korting.

За 4 часа игра не вылетала, оптимизация хорошая, был только 1 баг и то он смешной и не мешал играть (я говорю про катсцену), но абордажи не очень. Вообщем если вы любите фармить и развиваться, становиться сильнее, любите тематику пиратов, то покупайте ТОЛЬКО со скидкой.

Crossplay ausgeschalten, Firewall ausgemacht. Ob es daran lag, weiß ich nich, morgen werd ich alles mal wieder einschalten und versuchen.\n\nJedenfalls hab ich jetzt ein paar Stunden ingame verbracht und muss sagen... wenn man mal die anfänglichen 2-3h hinter sich hat, die grundlegenden Sachen verstanden und sich alles etwas angeschaut hat, macht es MEGA Fun. Hätte ich nicht erwartet.\n\nEs fühlt sich sehr smooth an und läuft auffällig flüssig. Keine Ruckler, keine Lags o.ä. Das Spielprinzip ist denkbar einfach und doch bietet S&B sehr viele Möglichkeiten. Grafisch ist es sehr detailreich und lädt zum Erkunden, Segeln und Questen ein.\n\nKann es nach nun etwa 10h guten Gewissens weiter empfehlen und für die 24€ im Sale aktuell ist es wirklich ein Schnapper. Gerne mehr davon.\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\nZusatz: habe mir heute nochmal ein paar der Rezensionen durchgelesen. Geschmäcker sind verschieden, keine Frage. Doch es ärgert mich doch immer sehr wenn Leute \"Rezessionen\" schreiben die nicht der Wahrheit entsprechen, Halbwahrheiten beinhalten oder nicht repräsentativ sind. Hier ein paar \"Nachträge\":\n\n- es ist ein \"Loot\"-Shooter im RP/MMO Mantel\n\n- \"langweilig\" von Leuten die 0,3 oder 0,5h in einem RP/MMO verbracht haben?? Der Tiefgang beginnt in diesem Genre SCHON IMMER erst nach mehreren Stunden. Wir sind hier nicht bei \"The Witcher 3\" oder einem Hack&Slay wo ständig nur geballere und Action herrscht. Grundsätzlich geht es darum sich seine Schiffe zu erspielen, zu equippen, zu verschönern und Handelsrouten aufzubauen. Sagt ihr nach 2h Schweine töten in WoW auch es ist langweilig??\n\n- \"ruckler beim Laden\", \"es ist verpixelt in der Videosequenz\", \"Grafik altbacken\", vielleicht solltet ihr mal eure Hard-/Software erneuern für ein \"Ladebildschirm\" freie Welt dieser Größenordnung und diesem Detailgrad wo selbst kleine Schwalben hinter den Segeln beim Einfahren in einen Hafen erkennbar sind... ich weiß ja nicht was ihr noch wollt. Evtl. mal die Settings auch hoch drehen XD XD\n\n- Steuerung schwammig: An \"Land\" der \"RP Teil\" nicht das 0+Ultra aber \"ok\". Doch die Verteilung beläuft sich hier etwa auf 90/10 von - mit dem Schiff fahren und mit dem Char durch die Welt tingeln\n\n- \"bessere vergleichbare Spiele\": Mir wäre mal von \"Sea of Thieves\" abgesehen kein einziges bekannt. Nicht in dieser Größenordnung, Grafiksetting oder Vielfalt an Möglichkeiten. Nicht einmal im Ansatz. Wer solche \"Vergleiche\" zieht, darf dann auch ruhig sauber argumentieren und die \"besseren Spiele\" benennen :P\n\n- \"Shooter ohne Sinn\": (Verfasser 0,5h Spielzeit) Tutorial gespielt und dann ausgeschalten? Es ist und bleibt ein nennen wir es \"Kriegsschiff Simulator\" im RP/MMO Stil. Was habt ihr erwartet?\n\n- \"Spiel ein Witz, kein AAA Titetl\": ja, ursprünglich sollte es so verkauft werden korrekt. Doch spielt das wirklich eine Rolle? Entweder mir gefällt ein Game und macht Fun oder nicht. SaB ist definitiv kein Spiel für \"nur\" 40-50h hier können hunderte an Stunden \"versenkt\" werden wenn es richtig gezockt werden soll. Von daher kann man wie ich finde auch gerne von einem Vollpreistitel sprechen (aber hauptsache fürs 3D-Kino + Popcorn/Cola und 2h Spaß 35 Euro zahlen - das ist was anderes) :P",

Finally get into the game and the first thing is to change my appearance. Even that was super clunky and not intuitive, at all.\n\nFigured it out and had to go talk to the main pirate guy but the cut scenes just look awful (and there is a pointlessly long load time for each). I do not know how to describe the look of this game other than square edged, low quality renderings. 100% immersive breaking. Well, as soon as I accepted the very first quest, the game crashed.\n\nYep, gimme my 24 bucks back. Thanks but no thanks.\n\n<GAME OVER>",

Don't buy this game expecting it to be AC black flag 2, that's not what this is. All of the combat is navel combat, no on foot combat and no boarding combat. The ship combat is very good tho, you have an array of weapons and ships to choose from, you've got your tanks, supports, and dps ships, and you have cannons, mortars, mine layers, long-range cannons, even guns that heal allies.\nYou will meet an array of characters that guide you through your pirate adventure, some people say the voice acting is bad but I'm not sure what they are talking about, the voice acting is solid. While you are not glued to your ship, you will have the opportunity to walk around towns as your pirate to interact with shops and other players, They are like your hub worlds. For those of you scarred about a repeat of Sea of Thieves this game has a pvp flag that you must raise at a hub in order to attack and receive damage from other players so don't worry about getting griefed by high-level players.I did think it was weird to limit it to three players a party instead of 4. The game kind of wants to be a mmo with the way classes and weapons along with leveling are set up.\nThe combat is fun and intense, the boarding minigame has some room for improvement as all you do it throw a hook onto the enemy ship but its quite literally hit or miss and I can figure out the method to ensure it lands.\nRight now the game is in a really good state as of now and I will admit it had a rough launch but look at Sea of Thieves, that game had a disastrous launch, and its an amazing game now, no doubt if Ubisoft puts in the effort this game can also be really great game. But overall I'd say the game is worth getting, haven't experienced any crashes or game-breaking bugs so its been a clean experience.\n\nUpdate: I've spent some time playing the game and it is extremely fun\nDon't listen to the bad reviews this game is worth a play\nend of the day if you like a focus on boarding a on foot combat but lacking inn navel combat play sea of thieves if you want a focus on naval combat but lacking on foot/boarding then skull and bones is for you\nI would love to see larger ships enter the game in the future",

Overall a fun game with a grabbing story immediately, you're thrown into John Scurlocks crew and have many of missions to complete for him. Been enjoying it so far and ive had ONE MAJOR BUG the entire time i've played, the game has a tendency to crash when youre editing your ship and the weapons on it, unsure why but i've had it crash 3 times in this screen within my 3 hours of play time so far.

For the rest it's more adrenaline-filled to dig the earth on stardew valley than playing this game.\n\nSide note: I have a really good PC and internet connection (I downloaded the game in about five minutes, my average ping on google is 3ms yada yada), and there are too many graphical issues, frame drops and other issues.",

I played the closed beta, along with the free trial, which didn't end for me as I was able to play it longer than I was meant to, before finally it stopped working. So, I picked it up on sale when it released on steam. The game is all about your ship, there are on-foot sections, but they are either just in a safe zone, or you can roam around gathering resources. The movement is clunky and annoying though, so it kinda sucks.\n\nThe ship crafting and customization is where it gets pretty fun! You can really make your ship your own, building it how you want. You want to be a speedy bugger that rams? Go for it! You wanna tank and have giant shotgun cannons? Yup! It is very relaxing roaming around in your ship, doing some trading, and listening to sea shanties.\n\nThis game should have been a next gen Sea of Thieves, but was not. If you enjoy roaming around on a ship, hunting down pirates and trading, pick it up on a hefty sale. 30 bucks at MAX.",

        "content": "Posted: August 26\nThe game is fun. It's not worth the full price and even the $36 for the Premium edition is a tough sell when there are still issues in the game and it is most definitely not a AAAA game. I think Ubisoft needs to lower the price to $20 for base game and then $30 for Deluxe and $35 for Premium or just go straight to free to play and focus on mainly cosmetics and season passes to fun future development.\n\nAs for the game. The majority of the quests are fetch quests and go blow this ship up with occasionally adding in a few escort quests. I haven't gotten to end game yet so I don't know about any big sea creature or legendary boats as of yet, but hopefully there are some and given the screenshots there might be. The story is pretty lacking and I wish it was a little better considering the main game play is ship battles with occasionally walking around a port. It's not bad, but not really good either. It's right there in the middle which is why the full price tag of $60 for the base game is a hard sell. The game does have potential and people should give it a try especially while it's on sale cause the ship combat is pretty fun and if you've played Black Flag you know what it's like. The ship customization is real nice as well. You can build different types of boats and outfit them how ever you like.\n\nAs for bugs. There hasn't been many, but the few I have found can be annoying. Server Lag is an issue, there are times where buttons will stop working like J for Journal or I to open inventory which requires you to quit to the main menu in order for them to work again or sometimes the server will lag and shops or quest givers icons won't show up so you can't use them again requiring you to quit to main menu. So far in about 8 hours that's all I have found and it doesn't happen all the time, but when it does it is annoying.\n\nAnd finally for the season passes you unlock season points fairly quickly without much grinding at least for early game as I can't say for end game, but it's nice just getting points just from playing naturally from just doing quests and blowing up ships. As usual a lot of the really good stuff is behind the Premium pass, but there are a lot of cool free stuff as well.\n\nOverall good game. Just not a AAAA game and not worth it at full price.",

I actually loved and welcomed a few changes... And while moving about on land feels odd and unnecessary, it also adds to the pirate feeling. No, you can't climb buildings, you can't even climb your own ship... But that's not the game's focus. And if you've come from AC4, you're constantly get reminded of it.\n\nI for one like the fact that I don't have to jump off the ship to loot some islands on the shore. That takes time... Sure, it'd be a nice addition. As well as \"plundering\" villages is simplifyed into a holdout. Maybe Ubi can try adding, expanding on these fronts if they are able to listen.\n\nHowever. This is a Pirate Ship game. Not a Pirate game. And I believe it does what it intends to do: A grindy Ubi game that has lots to see and lots to do.",

(DLC specifically, but also the price of the game when it is not on sale)\n\nIt's all f****ng terrible, I agree, no argument there.\nThis review is however about this specific game, and positive as you've noticed.\n\nThe first trailer promised something amazing, but game never got made.\nI lost interest when I took note of the fact this game wouldn't be what it promised it would be years ago.\nThis plus my dislike to the Ubisoft launcher made me not even bat an eye at the release of this game.\nThe current release on steam + sale made me have a fresh look, knowing I have a strong dislike towards the studio's choices as of the past few years.\n\nI was hesitant to buy this game at €24,00,- , seeming my prejudice, but I don't regret my purchase.\n\nTo everyone who had expectations, like I did a few years back, before they pushed the release back further and further....\n-No, this is not a Black Flag MMO\n-No, this is not a good RPG\n\nHOWEVER\nI abandoned all hope for this game and expected it to not amount to anything, and what I found at €24 was a decent game.\nA game where the third person aspect was underwhelming, sure.\nYet a game that kept me entertained with decent questlines, good progression, good sound, good graphics (could do with some upgrades at this point UBI, it's not ugly, but it isn't smooth for the level of graphics compared to any UE4/5 game) etc.\n\nAll in all, people b*tch because they didn't get what they want, because it's Ubisoft, and although I don't disagree, at the current sale (again, €24) it's worth it to me.\nI hate buying Ubisoft because it supports them, but when something entertains me without insulting me for a few hours +, that's worth a small investment.\n\nI'm actually enjoying it, though I hope Ubi takes some turns in the future patching this game, this DEI s**t (although not extremely strong, yet present in this game) isn't it.\n\nTL;DR:\nI don't disagree with any of the people ranting, you're right, there is problems at UBI, true.\nhowever, if you don't expect a Black Flag upgrade, is pretty good for €24.\nDon't buy it over that price because its not a AAAA game like Yves Guillemot would have you believe.\n(Also no, AAAA isn't a thing, and if it were Ubisoft would be the last company to reach that level, everyone knows this)",

But I've already got 58 hours into it since the game came out on Steam, so apparently it's quite fun. Wish it had land combat though, no swords and pistol fights :(\n\nI bought the version with the season pass because, well, if you are going to play a live service game (e.g. Diablo 4), you will of course miss out on a lot if you don't. This game goes one step further because I obtained the new seasons weapons (not blueprints you have to craft) through that season pass.\n\nI assume that the blueprint of the new ship is free for everyone, but you will have grind to get the weapons blueprint and craft them without. Not that it matters much, it just takes longer and you can't avoid the end-game grind anyway. (I am currently grinding for gear i missed in the first two seasons and to level up my ship).\n\nAnd off course trying to get my empire up and running by manufacturing and selling booze and drugs, I love the empire management aspect of the game lol.",

        "content": "Posted: August 26\nJe ne recommande pas ce jeu pour les raisons suivantes : (il y a quand même un peu de positif a la fin ^^)\n- Aucun combat au CAC, pas d’arme, uniquement des batailles navales. Même lors des abordages de navires, aucun combat, une pauvre anime de l’abordage … donc que la maps soit pas « parcourable » à pied parce que ce n’est pas le propo du jeu et que surement « FLEMME », mais bon un pistolet ? Pour un jeu de pirate, pas de sabre, pas de pistolet, ça fait très mal.\n- Le jeu est vide de joueurs, malgré une promotion de 60%. Dommage pour un jeu axé sur le multi. Bonne chance a vous pour trouver quelqu’un pour faire des activités … surtout que ces activités multi sont du coup infaisable en solo (ou alors il faut avoir un niveau bien supérieur au bots)\n- Certaines quêtes importantes ne se mettent pas à jours. Les indications et les tutoriaux bugent, donc quand on revient parce que le jeu a planté, bah « bonne chance », je suis passé absolument à côté de la gestion de colonie grâce à cela.\n- Des bugs absolument insupportables, du type : téléportation en continue sur un point de la carte … j’ai rage quitté car après presque 20h de jeu, je me fais téléporter en boucle et cela même en relançant le jeu / pc … je sais pas si je vais relancer ce jeu.\n- Beaucoup trop de ressource monétaire différente, ainsi que de « farming »\n- L’interface est bugée de partout (en plus de lagé)… que cela soit les menu ou le chargement des vendeurs, si on va trop vite, il ne charge pas tous donc vous pouvez vendre, mais rien ne se passe … Ou bien au clique sur un bouton, rien ne change (aucune indication visuel), on ne sait pas si cela a fonctionné ... le chat est contre intuitif, « N » pour y accéder (WTF), et on n’a pas le focus sur le champ texte, inutile de cliquer dessus, je vous révèle la solution, il faut taper du texte pour avoir le focus …. Si vous cliquer sur un élément par-dessus la carte, attention, ça clique aussi en-dessous et donc vous avez régulièrement la surprise de vous téléporter … bref ce n’est pas la folie, cela snif le jeux console mal adapter … dommage pour un AAAA\n- Même le site de support pour rapporter un bug est mal fait, on a accès un « tableau de board » type jira, mais c’est tous, pas la possibilité de rapporter quoique soit, donc vous êtes gentiment redirigé vers un discord (dont le lien n’est même pas cliquable sur le site) qui est intégralement cassé.\n- 10 pauvres bateaux différents …\n- Pas de gestion de flotte …\n\nGlobalement vous allez être frustré de jouer à ce jeu.\n\nBon sinon voici la raison qui fait que j’ai quand même +20 heures de jeux : les batailles navales sont fort sympathiques, la navigation maritime est très appréciable au niveau visuel et sonore (les chants des matelots, la mer qui est très bien faite, les mouvements des bateaux).\n\nDonc pour les fous de piraterie ou les joueurs occasionnels, passez votre chemin et relancer AC Black flag.",

The game sure has some bugs which are constantly being fixed each week with new content releasing as well. The game is not great or some \"AAAA\" game, some trolls might be telling you it supposedly is, but it's a good pirate game and for the price of 24 Euros on sale. Of course the grinding for materials is huge and I wish the game was less grindy. Say what you like about Ubisoft these days but this is a solid release. I'd say an 8/10 game.",

        "content": "Posted: August 24\n育碧的“大海盗时代”\n\n《碧海黑帆》是一款由育碧出品的海战动作角色扮演游戏，游戏很早以前就立项了，但是经历了多次跳票之后，才正式出现在玩家面前。游戏目前呈现的内容与官方的初衷有很大的出入。目前游戏给我的最大感受就是一个超大的海战罐头。但是不能否认的是游戏还是拥有一定的可玩性和内容深度，尤其是多人联机合作游玩，效果更佳。\n\n欢迎关注 网易UU鉴赏家培养计划\n关注UU加速器VX公众号，回复“steam”，获得专属玩家群邀请。\n\n你永远可以相信育碧的美工\n\n育碧近些年来推出的游戏，画面风格和美工是一顶一的棒，本作也不例外。游戏的背景发生在印度洋的群岛之上。大面积的海洋与群岛陆地的环境设计都非常优秀。海面波光粼粼，波涛汹涌，时不时的玩家还会遇上海上的暴风雨，带给玩家震撼的视觉效果。在海洋上，游戏还设计了大量的群岛，每一个岛屿都有自己独特的样子，岛上也有各种资源。无论玩家驾驶帆船驰骋的海面上，还是扮演海盗在岛屿上寻求宝藏，似乎每一个场景都值得截图。在大海上还有不计其数的木质帆船，代表着各种不同的派系。船只在水面上航行的效果与船只碰撞和相互攻击带来的爆炸破损效果也都非常优秀，在给玩家刺激的海战体验和视觉冲击力。\n\n\n在游戏发售之前，育碧说要打算推出一款海战游戏的时候，那时候铺天盖地的舆论和新游戏的介绍，给我的感觉像是《刺客信条：黑旗》的海战单独拿出来做了一款全新的海战游戏。那个时候我是非常期待的，不仅是我，相信很多喜爱黑旗的玩家都会感到兴奋。因为海战部分相当好玩，如果把这部分单独拿出来并加工，填充一些更多的内容，那么游戏毫无疑问的会是一款佳作。然而游戏经历了多次跳票之后，正式推出了，却与一开始的初衷相悖。目前的游戏给我的感觉更像是《刺客信条：奥德赛》的海战罐头加倍版，游戏的核心玩法是在并不怎么出彩的剧情中，扮演一名海盗并执行在海上的各项任务。主要的内容基本上就像我们对海盗的认知一样，通过击败海上的其他船只，劫掠他们的货物，或者前往各个码头进行城市的劫掠。虽然游戏支持把敌船打瘫，然后靠近登船，但是并没有登船战斗的过程，而且抛钩也是有命中几率，成功才能登船，一旦成功钩住就会直接结束，感觉失去了海战的一半内容。游戏基本上在前几个小时就能体验了大部分的核心玩法了。可惜的是作为一款海盗游戏，却没有太多陆地探索，宝藏搜刮，海盗决斗之类的内容。大部分时间玩家都在跑路和战斗，而游戏的海战也是开船和开炮的过程，总感觉重复度很高，而玩家能够提升海战的能力，也仅仅是通过更换数量较少的火炮和装甲来提升海战的战斗数值。游戏比较有趣的玩法可能在于挑战精英船只以及世界事件的团队合作之类的玩法。\n\n\n除去核心的海战玩法之外，游戏还提供了陆地探索，海洋捡垃圾，港口货物贸易等其他的玩法，算是缝合了很多优秀的玩法。但是比较可惜的是，本作虽然加入了这一些玩法，但是每一个玩法都是浅尝辄止，缺乏一定的深度。例如玩家虽然可以在陆地上操控玩家捏的海盗进行一系列活动，但是能够进行的内容少之又少。玩家基本上就是在陆地上进行捡垃圾，与NPC的交易交互，以及挖掘宝藏。当玩家完成任务以及在摧毁的船只中发现战利品藏宝图后，可以找到相应的位置进行宝藏的挖掘。游戏会在目的地以高亮显示可挖掘，但是当玩家千辛万苦寻找位置，开船，上陆地，费了九牛二虎之力找到了宝藏，得到的奖励却少的可怜。这就导致了很多玩家不想在陆地上探索，即便玩家不是冲着宝藏去的，在陆地上能够收集到的资源也少的可怜。\n\n此外本作游戏包含一个贸易模式，作为育碧游戏，游戏中还是有一个经济系统的。玩家可以花费银币去购买很多的装饰品来更换自己船只的样子，以及为自己的人物购买一些好看的衣服等等。而游戏中主要获得钱币的来源，便是贸易系统。游戏作为一个与船只打交道的游戏，船舶贸易一定是一个重要的组成部分，但是本作却把它做的四不像。作为贸易系统低买高卖是常识，而游戏在每个码头都设置了不同的NPC，出售不同的价格的物品，玩家只需要在低于正常价格的时候购买，并在其他港口以高于正常价格的价格出售即可赚得差价。让游戏中并没有任何方式能不影响市场经济。哪怕玩家为同一个港口提供了大量的物资，依然不会改变港口的贸易价格。游戏中的价格似乎是在一定时间内固定死的，这就让这个游戏的经济系统显得非常幼稚。而游戏中玩家无论获得多么丰富的资金，除了购买一些外观用品以及日常舰船的开销之外，就没有其他的用处了。也不会因为玩家拥有的财富而决定自己的等级或者地位。在这个世界中，海盗还是凭借名声来获得自己的地位。这种网游化的罐头，确实很难说得上是好的。\n\n\n本作游戏即便玩法上有所欠缺，缺乏深度。主要原因还是游戏是想做成一款多人在线的网游。想要对标《盗贼之海》，本作明显融合了更多的系统和更庞大的内容，但是在核心部分却总是差了那么一点。我不得不说，本作的多人联机合作玩法还是相当有趣的。无论玩家是输去做任务还是在海上挑战各种精英船只。玩家都可以在事件发生地与当地的其他做同一个任务的玩家共同挑战，仿佛大家挑战同一个世界boss一样。玩家也可以自己组建船队，与自己的三两好友一起共同探索整片海域，一起挑战精英船长，共同完成各种各样的任务，确实让游戏体验得到一定的提升。此外，通行证的存在，以及有些个体隐藏的各种外观宝箱和商人，让玩家能够获得一些独特的外观，在与其他人联机的时候，能够彰显自己独一无二的船只和人物，变成一款暖暖换装游戏。",

        "content": "Posted: August 27\nThe last time I heard about this game was 2018 and then I lost complete track of the game till a week ago where someone told me its out on Steam. So I checked it out and most people said its a trash game.\nWhat really confused me was that people who reviewed it on youtube said its a fun game and the gameplay looked fun and appealing to me. Since the game was for 24 Bucks on Steam I thought to check it out but wasnt sure. This were when someone told me that you can play a Free 6 hour demo on Ubiconnect.\nSo I tried it out and played 4 hours straight and after that I bought it on Steam.\n\nThe game is not bad. In no way. Actually the game is pretty fun. Is it a AAAA-Game? Of course not! It is a normal live service game like others it has it flaws but also it qualities. The Naval gameplay aka sailing your ship, upgrading it and fight on Sea is really well made and fun. The only little bummer is that there are many loading screens and little cutscenes/Animations which you cant skip. The loadingscreens mostly take 2 or 3 seconds which lead me to the question why you have to put a loadingscreen there and not build the game as a whole map like in sea of thieves? But well since they are so short its not that bad. The animations can be a bit frustrating. Everytime you board an enemy ship you dont do it by yourself but an animation is played which you cant skip.\nSo unlike in Sea of Thieves you dont really play as a person but as a ship with their crew. Which is not bad. Like I said its fun but its way different than in Sea of Thieves and people should be aware of it.\n\nI personally think when Ubisoft would have been more down to earth with the marketing and maybe would it make F2P, since its a Live Service Game they can still earn alot of moneys people wouldnt be mad about the game and wouldnt downvote it so much.\nThat there is no man to man combat with swords and pistols is not a problem. I must say I like it how it is. The fact that the naval combat is well thought makes the game more unique.\n\nAnd we dont need to talk about the graphic. Its stunning. The game is really beautiful.\n\nEDIT: One thing I forgot to mention is that the world feels really alive. the oceans are not empty. Beside the other player you have alot of NPC ships sailing around. Either just patroling or transport cargo which you can all attack and plunder. There are even different faction which can attack each other so you sail on the open sea and see on the horizon a few NPC ships battling against each other. There are different weather conditions too like storm and there are sea monsters and many world events.\n\nSo here my Fazit:\nIts not a AAAA-Game but its still a good and fun game. Its not a Sea of Thieves clone since you play more your ship with crew and less a individual character but this is not bad. On this way it has more its own identity. Many loadingscreens and unskipable animations which can be a bit annoying but they are just a few seconds long so its not that bad. No man to man combat but the game dont need this.\n\nI really hope the game will survive and gets a lot support from the developer since its really a nice game. They just had to be more down to earth with it back then.\nGraphics and animations/effects are really beautiful.",

Firstly, after reading the reviews and watching reviews I thought I was gonna play and end up refunding, but turns out I’m hours into the game.\nIt’s really not up to expectation but it’s there as a pirate game, just lacking hand to hand combat. Other than that it’s a somewhat nice and fun game to play, though it takes a bit to understand some other mechanics.\nThe game honestly don’t deserve the full hate, it’s the initial hype part that ended up in disappointment.\nWould recommend the game, but if you are into hand to hand or boarding then maybe AC4 Black Flag is for you.\nIf Naval combat is sufficient and you want multiplayer than this is for you, but please trial the game before purchasing, it’s worth it to buy when it’s on discount.\n\nTrial the game first before leaving a neg feedback",

Once I have all the achievements I wont be coming back to this game. I would only recommend this game if you are an achievement hunter like myself. Thanks for the achievements Ubisoft, please add them to your other games.\n\nThis game had so much potential but it plays like a game from the PS3 or PS4 era. Controls are wonky, graphics are average, game play is fun half the time and there are bugs. All they had to do is expand on the amazing pirate play from Assassins Creed Black Flag. Instead we got this live service thing. You can't board enemy ship for melee combat, you can only fast travel to limited places and there is a fee to fast travel...EXCUSE ME this is my ship who is collecting this fee?\n\nLook else where for a pirate experience. If you really want to get it on sale and by sale I mean a deep discount.",

I have enjoyed learning the nuances of the naval mechanics (which are pretty simple to pick up) and exploring the map for locations, resources, and other activities/challenges. I find it rewarding and worth the sale price to play.\nIt is a game with some grind, so it may not be for everyone. I've enjoyed the story lines tied to missions and the voice acting is good.",

Nachdem ich mir die Trailer angeschaut und die Ankündigungen gelesen hatte, hatte ich große Erwartungen an dieses Piratenspiel. Doch was ich letztendlich bekam, war eine entmutigende Mischung aus fehlenden Innovationen und uninspirierter Gestaltung.\n\nTrotz neuster Hardware ist die Grafik oft nicht auszuhalten. Es gibt Pixelfehler und Grafikfehler an jeder Ecke. Bereits in den ersten Minuten laggt das Bild und die Videosequenzen laufen mehrfach stockend, während die Grafik direkt nach dem Tutorial auch völlig verschwommen wirkt.\n\nDas Gameplay selbst fühlt sich ebenso unausgereift an wie die Grafik. Vor über 15 Jahren spielte ich bereits ein Piratenspiel, das grafisch zwar schlechter war als „Skull and Bones“, aber spielerisch wesentlich realistischer war und um Welten mehr Spaß gemacht hat.\n\nFazit: Wenn das Kaufen eines AAAA-Titels nicht gleichzusetzen ist mit dem tatsächlichen Besitz, habe ich kein schlechtes Gewissen dabei, dieses Spiel zu kaufen, nur um eine schlechte Rezension zu verfassen und es anschließend zurückzugeben. Es gibt einfach bessere Optionen, die deine Zeit und dein Geld wert sind.",

I'm not sure if the overall game is worth the non-sale intro price tho.\n\nTheres a lot worse out there for more than $25 - I wont mention any Asian Market names, because that wouldnt Be Human of me or polite to any First Descendants. Anyways moving on!\n\nFirst impression its fine so far. Feels like most of the naval warfare is from AC Black Flag, which is great.\n\nIts not a pirate sail boat simulator; thank yew Baby Jesus!\n\nAltho, I do have this odd feeling that Ubi will flip this to F2P and trash the game down to mobile quality, but hey, who is NOT doing that with their game today anyway.\n\nIf I discover anything more I'll adjust my review, as always. Well sometimes. Maybe. Probably wont.",

Cant talk too much trash about the sambuk because its my favorite UPS truck on the seas.\n\nSecond off this game is a GRIND until you get into kingpin and can just buy resources. Prior to season 3 you use to not be able to craft a whole lot of the components so this is a major QOL improvement BUT now theres a few more components you have to hunt for. I think the QOL improvements outweigh the 2-3 things added\n\nLastly join the official discord if you have any questions about playing. Holy cow did I need so much help starting out and theres dozen of community members who will answer all your questions. Seriously though dont come to the steam reviews if you're on the fence. Go have a 5 minute conversation with people who have been playing since season 1 and KNOW the game.",

In and of itself a good game that is worth selling even if it is not an AAAA game in my opinion. However, YOU HAVE to note that it is not an AC4 remake or anything like that but a PURE ship / pirate game. If you do this then you have no false hopes. I hope we can finally end Review Bombing because it does not really reproduce the game but is only pure aggression. This also hurts the developers who program very good games but are (forced) by the publisher to do it differently. That a game is bad is often not because of the developers but rather the publishers.\nAnd yes, this might sound a bit weird but I accidentally bought the wrong edition and now I have to refund it to buy the right one. I'm not the kind of person who writes a review and then gets refunded to defend the game XD",

If you don't mind that there is no land combat, buy this game. The ship combat is amazing. Huge amount of diverse builds with different ships, weapons, and furniture (provide passives).\n\nThis is an interesting game from the wider gaming community. There is a swath of people hating on the game without even playing it. This divisiveness is only something I've experience with nostalgia making me like a game, but it's was worse than I remember.\n\nRemember to think for yourself when purchasing this game. There is a reason Ubi provides quite an extensive full game demo for a fixed time period. Companies only do this when they are confident about a product. In fact, it was this free demo that got me so confused. I was expecting this game to be AWFUL based on the hate it was getting and was shocked when I discovered this is actually in my top 10 favorite games I've ever played. I'm not saying it will be that way for you, but it's worth checking out.",

Sure, it’s not perfect it has its flaws, like the inability to board enemy ships and limited character customization. But the ship combat more than makes up for it. I’ve found myself really enjoying the game for what it is. A lot of people try to compare it to Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, but they’re not the same game, and it was never advertised as such, so I’m not sure why that comparison keeps coming up. I do wish the map were bigger, because right now it feels a bit small, but overall, the game is still very enjoyable whether you’re playing solo or with a group. If you’re looking for a fun adventure and want to experience a different kind of pirate game, this one’s worth checking out. Worst case, you don’t like it and get a refund within the 2-hour trial. Don’t let others decide for you give it a try, and you might end up having a great time.",

Obviously the game went through development hell, but at it's core the game delivers on the inciting concept - Black Flag's naval combat, with multiplayer and more depth. It's definitely not for everyone, but it checks the important boxes for me.\n\nAt present the devs at Ubi Singapore seem to be doing a decent job adding content and addressing player feedback. (the season 3 patch notes are a great example)\n\n\nIMO, on-foot gameplay comparisons to games like SoT and AC:IV are usually made without consideration to how vastly they differ on a technical level.\n- ie: Synchronizing the AI for dozens if not hundreds of enemy NPCs on multiple ships, all in the same world space, or even on the same screen, for every nearby player... Given how fast-paced the combat is, good luck not getting the ship shot out from under you. (if your CPU doesn't melt first)\n\nThis ain't GTA and Ubi is not Rockstar lmao\n\nAll said, I still think it's fair to criticize the game's shortcomings. The lack of on-foot interactions like swimming, diving, and roaming around your ships is definitely a bummer. It'd also be great if the servers weren't so... Ubisoft.",

        "content": "Posted: August 23\nThe game is fun, simple, and lovely, grew tired of playing SoT, and this game is unique. Do give it a go and see what YOU think, if you enjoy it, great, hopefully your friend gives it a go. If you don't like the game, that's okay, BUT saying \"This game sucks\", \"This isn't the Blackflag HD we got\", won't help the Devs make the game better if you want this game to be better than before, don't hate the Devs, give the Dev's valid constructive criticism. Hate Ubisoft for their poor decision making.\n\nThe characters, musics, atmosphere, unique ships, weapons, and armor, Makes the game quite fun. Same for the Sea Lords like Philippe La Peste and the Hubac Twins.\n\nBut I do have some cons about this game: The story does need some fixing, the graphics on the characters like their hair and beards, give us the ability to board enemies ship with our crew and our pirates and not a cutscene, explore our own boats, have the proper model of the captains we're fighting (Ex. Seeing Armand Hubac driving his ship than a generic pirate driving it), the ability to swim and dive underwater, and maybe bring back old concepts from the 2018 build. (And yes, land combat, but I see them adding it when its READY to be added), the game still have some problems here and there, simply report the issue than whining about it, please.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, it may not be for everyone, but still playable and enjoyable. If you play SoT and want a different pirate game, or just like me, done with SoT, give this game a go. SoT and AC: Blackflag are two completely different games, and SnB doesn't have to be JUST like them.",

На удивление не смотря на то с какой силой льется хейт на игру мне она даже весьма понравилась. Я не знаю что вкладывали создатели в название AAAA игра но это вполне добротный мультиплеерный MMO RPG в пиратской тематики с очень приятной графикой и интересными боями. Есть несколько элементов которые допустим не хватают этой игре например возможность ходить по кораблю более расширенного абордаж чтоб можно было в нем участвовать как в Assasins cread Black Flag а так же возможность охоты с гарпуном это бы дало возможность людям просто проводить досуг в игре по разному. В целом эта игра это Sea of tunes на максималках но почему то на Sea of tunes не льется столько отрицательных отзывов хотя там так же есть платные скины в ней меньше разнообразных миссий в ней хуже графика в ней так же можно играть с друзьями. Но почему то именно Skull and Bones удостоилась такого хейта абсолютно не заслуженно моя оценка этой игре 8 из 10 что является показателем выше среднего а не как не ниже. Решать конечно потребителю самому но не смотрите на игру как на сюжетку про пиратов смотрите на нее как на MMO RPG в пиратской тематике потому что механики заданий абсолютно одинаковы. Как то так",

(without the limited sword play) and you'll enjoy it as you sail your ship around a vast map, plundering settlements, terrorising supply lines, upgrading your ship, making rum and smuggling goods!\n\nThis is a far better single player experience than Sea of Thieves and currently less than half the price too! However, forget the AAAA+ Ubisoft claims - this game isn't AAAA+. It's definitely worth £20 but if you'd bought in at £70 then you may feel a little different.\n\nHowever, ignore the Ubisoft hate. This is a solid game that will keep you entertained for a long time.\n\n***Update After Further Play Time***\n\nThe game gets better the longer you play it. It's not all about sinking ships or running errands for people - you have an empire to expand which includes making and distributing rum, gin, opium etc.\n\nThere's even the ability to \"take-over\" industrial settlements and turn them into your own illicit goods production centres that then generate pieces of eight for you over time.\n\nSet up a rum production industry and you can then transport the required sugar cane to increase production speed which gives you a real choice on whether to go and buy the goods legally as a trader, go out hunting them as a privateer or take on the daily supply missions which usually involve running through very hostile waters and trying not to get sunk!\n\nMap size is pretty good - it takes a long time to sail from one end to the other but once you've opened a port up you can fast travel to it which saves time but often it can be a good idea not to fast travel so that you can gather resources as you sail from one location to another.\n\nThe bigger ships also handle really nicely with a good feeling of weight to them. Ship combat gets even more interesting once you've got in to the medium sized ships which have more configuration options, more guns and usually an auxiliary weapon system such as rockets or mortars.\n\nIt's also worth noting that I am soloing this game just fine.\n\n\n1. Needs to be installed on an SSD drive otherwise you'll encounter loading screens every time you try to do something in port which quickly becomes annoying. Once on an SSD loading screens are totally gone!\n\n2. I've had a number of crashes when in port. Thankfully no progress lost.",

        "content": "Posted: August 23\nOnce upon a time in the swashbuckling realm of high seas and treacherous tides, there lived a rather peculiar pirate named Captain Dark. Unlike his fearsome name, Captain Dark was an unassuming fellow with a peculiar hobby: he was obsessed with video games. Not just any video games, but the most notorious bug-riddled, glitch-infested pirate game ever conceived: Skull and Bones.\n\nCaptain Dark had stumbled upon Skull and Bones during a particularly dreary evening in the local tavern, where he was nursing a mug of grog and lamenting his crew's unfortunate fashion choices. The game, notorious for its rampant bugs and clunky mechanics, was both reviled and revered among gamers. Intrigued by its reputation, Captain Dark decided to embark on a daring quest of his own: to conquer this digital sea of chaos and become the mightiest pirate kingpin in the virtual world.\n\nArmed with nothing but his wits and an ancient gaming console he had salvaged from the wreckage of a forgotten shipwreck, Captain Dark set sail into the pixelated waters of Skull and Bones. His first challenge was to navigate the treacherous waves of corrupted code and glitched enemies. His ship, the Junk Sail, was a wobbly vessel plagued by bizarrely shifting textures and inexplicable lag. Nonetheless, Captain Dark embraced these challenges with a blend of cunning and humor, delighting in the absurdity of his predicament.\n\nThe path to greatness in Skull and Bones was fraught with bizarre anomalies: enemies would occasionally float in mid-air, treasure chests would spontaneously vanish, and the sea itself seemed to glitch into a surreal tapestry of colors. But Captain Dark was undeterred. He used the chaos to his advantage, learning to exploit the game's quirks with a savvy that soon became the stuff of legend among players.\n\nAs Captain Dark progressed through the game, he amassed a crew of digital misfits who were as eccentric as the game itself. There was Peg-Leg Pete, who had a tendency to glitch through walls, and Scurvy Sam, whose piratical dialogue was perpetually stuck in a loop. Together, they forged an unbreakable bond in the face of absurd challenges, transforming each bug into an opportunity for brilliance.\n\nWith every triumph and every glitchy victory, Captain Dark's reputation grew. He mastered the art of exploiting the game's many bugs, turning what others saw as frustrations into stepping stones to greatness. His name became synonymous with ingenuity and daring, and soon he was hailed as the undisputed kingpin of Skull and Bones.\n\nBut as with all great tales, there came a time for Captain Dark to part with his beloved Junk Sail. It was not out of necessity but out of a whimsical sense of adventure. Having conquered the virtual seas and made a name for himself, Captain Dark decided it was time to sail off into new horizons. He auctioned off the Junk Sail, now a legendary vessel of both glitchy charm and unparalleled combat prowess, to the highest bidder.\n\nThe sale was a grand affair, attended by digital and real-world pirates alike. The Junk Sail was sold for a princely sum, and Captain Dark, now a hero both in-game and out, bid farewell to his pixelated adventures. He sailed away, leaving behind a legacy of laughter, ingenuity, and the reminder that even in the face of chaos, a true pirate's spirit never falters.\n\nAnd so, the tale of Captain Dark, the master of Skull and Bones, became a legend in its own right—a whimsical yet serious reminder that with enough creativity and resilience, even the most bug-riddled of adventures can lead to greatness.",

Simply bought it here because of the political hate train against Ubisoft games. I don't care about corporations as they are all bad as there are no good ones, what I care about are games themselves. And I enjoyed this game.\n\nIf you enjoy sailing ships and a more arcade type feel with all sorts of fast paced combat this is a fun game. Sailing games are hard to do well though. There is the Microsoft Sea of Thieves but I could never get into that game because it is very much multiplayer driven. Just don't enjoy that at all.\n\nIf you enjoy old ship combat that is more arcade with some supernatural and different seasons with different things to do from time to time you will enjoy this. Grab on sale and have fun. You will easily have a solid 40 to 60 hours of fun and could drop in and out from time to time if you like.",

        "content": "Posted: August 28\nI am gonna organize this review out with sections so you can skip around to whatever you care to read.\n\nOverall personal feelings about the game:\nThe game isn't for everyone and I wouldn't buy the game if you are expecting a remastered black flag experience or a sea of thieves experience. This is more like the division except with ships and way less grind. There are some elements that feel inspired by black flag like the ship upgrade system, looting system, and the towns. But I don't think it will be able to come close to black flag since I am a firm believer that nothing will compare to playing a game for the first or one that was the first of it's kind even if it's a second play through of that game. With that said, I feel it's unfair to compare it to black flag or sea of thieves (if that's your thing). But for me personally, I thoroughly enjoy the game and plan on playing it for a while. I do wish there were more ships and more variety in what you could use, but the game did just release in February so there's still time for it to correct and add more stuff. I get expectations were high since Ubisoft is a big name developer but honestly, this is better then what I expected when you compare it to the release of Overwatch 2 or the 16th Call of Duty game coming out that's just a reskin of a previous one. Anyway, I am gonna move on with the rest of the review. I do recommend giving the game a try but just don't get your expectations too high and avoid going into this knowing very little about it or thinking it's going to be something that it definitely isn't.\n\nEnemy ships PvE:\nEnemy ships are pretty weak even when ganged up on even when ganging up on you. Every combat feels pretty much the same until you get later into the game and then some of the ships can repair each other or get different weapons but even then it becomes a pretty mind numbing experience with bosses and forts being the only real challenge. There's currently just not enough variety right now.\n\nBosses:\nMost bosses if not all of them can be taken out solo or with one other person if you are the correct rank or higher and take your time with it. The fights don't last very long with being able to kill them in 5 to 10 minutes at most. Some of the bosses are pretty tanky even with a higher rank ship and then they rely on calling in several other ships to kill you. The 2 hardest boss encounters are: The convoy bosses have a tendency to target your sails and immobilize you while they just run away until they escape off the edge map and call an endless number of enemy ships to swarm you and slow you down. The leviathan bosses are easy to take care but can almost one hit you while they hide under the water or behind waves so you can't fight back. You can leave the boss area at any point but have to return after a certain amount of time which makes it easy to just cheese the boss fights but is nice if you over estimated your ability to kill the boss.\n\nPlayer Ships:\nThe ship designs are pretty bad, they look like the sawed a bot in half then used flex seal to glue the front of the ship onto the back of the ship. Which they did us dirty by not really showing the ships except for in first person, far away shot, or at certain angles so you can't see the full ship. There also not a large variety of the ships you can choose from especially early game. Which wouldn't be a problem if the ships looked better then they do currently. There is a decent variety of weapons and where you can equip them on your ship but it's nothing special. Every ship does have a unique passive to make things easier but it also limits you pretty hard to certain play style or weapon combo. I will definitely say some ships are way stronger then others to the point there's not really a point to grind for other ships.\n\nQuest:\nThe quest are pretty generic and mostly go here, kill this, now come back or go here, look for this thing, now come back. In the early game this isn't a huge issue since along the way you can collect resources or kill AI ships for resources since there's always something to grind for. But late game, this gets pretty tedious pretty quickly especially when the fast travel points are pretty far from each other and you can only fast travel from somewhere you can dock at or you can fast travel to an event from anywhere. (Which I do to get places quicker and then just leave the event area.) Some of the quests either aren't very self explanatory or don't give you a whole lot to work with leaving you sometimes confused on what to do next.\n\nCosmetics and customization:\nYou can customize your ship, captain, and somewhat your crew. Most of the customization can be either earned or you can grind for the currency to buy it which is nice. There is very little to customizing your captains psychical appearance with only be able to select a few options from a couple of categories.\n\nPVP:\n(I personally prefer no PVP) There's little to no PVP that you have to participate in so you can go the whole game without ever fighting another player which is for the best since the ships aren't very well balanced to fight each other. You can choose to get into a lot of PVP action but that doesn't mean you actually will since you can choose to flag for PVP or not while adventuring around. So this ends up being more a PVE experience than a PVP one. Especially since there's only about 10 other players in your world at a time.\n\nGrind:\nThere very little grinding in this game to where you don't really have to go a focus on grinding for certain things until you reach the end game and that is still not that bad. Now that being said, some things are behind a timer but for the most part you can avoid the timers but you can normally grind either something else entirely or you can grind a different way to get what you need. Which is probably meant to slow people down from just grinding to the end game content in a day.\n\nEvents:\nThere's 2 different kind of events, special boss events and game events. We'll start with the boss events, the boss events feel pretty generic and feel like a reskinned vanilla boss event. You get pretty good rewards from them so it's worth just shutting off your brain and dealing with them. I have yet to really participate in a game event so no idea but from the sound of the most recent on one they did, it didn't seem like anything special.\n\nForts and Towns:\nYou can plunder forts and towns for certain materials but you don't go with your crew, you stay on the ship with most of crew and fight waves of enemy ships trying to stop you while waiting on a bar to progress. These are pretty easy except for the towers or fortifications. They deal a lot of damage but are pretty easy to just snipe from a distance before you even start the plundering event.",

No es un juego de categoría AAAA, y está claro que Ubisoft infló las expectativas para justificar su precio y para intentar cubrir los problemas de gestión que hubo en su desarrollo. Sin embargo, eso no quita que sea un buen videojuego.\n\nAntes de decidirme a comprarlo, probé la demo de 6 horas que ofrece Ubisoft. Bastaron apenas 3 horas de juego para darme cuenta de que estaba ante un título con mucho potencial y que definitivamente quería tener.\n\nEl juego cuenta con un lore profundo y una gran variedad de mecánicas que lo hacen muy entretenido. Desde recolectar y pescar hasta cocinar y farmear, las actividades que puedes realizar son variadas y esenciales para progresar. Además, la posibilidad de hacer contrabando y explorar los mares, donde siempre hay algo nuevo que descubrir, lo convierte en una experiencia muy inmersiva.\n\nOjalá más personas se animen a darle una oportunidad. Muy recomendado.",

        "content": "Posted: August 27\n作为育碧推出的一款多人海战游戏，本作相较于《刺客信条》中的海战更加专注于纯粹的海面战争，碧波荡漾的海面之上确实不平静的各式大炮的轰鸣声，随着炮火的绽放一艘艘船只被埋葬海底，游戏优秀的画面完美的为玩家展现了海战的魅力，同时游戏足量的不同种类的船只和各式各样的大炮甚至是陈设装甲以及外观满足了玩家对于船只的高度自定义要求。但是稍显遗憾的是游戏内容玩法上重复度有些过高。\n\n太长不看版购买指南\n波澜壮阔的海面战争\n丰富的船只和各式各样的大炮以及装甲陈设组成的丰富选择性\n熟悉的育碧罐头味道\n内容玩法上重复度稍高\n\n说起海战笔者脑海中第一个想到的既不是《刺客信条》系列中从黑旗衍生出的海战玩法，也不是著名的《加勒比海盗》，而是从小每天晚上在电视机前等着观看的《海贼王》，其中海战的场景虽然不少，但是依旧被动漫中极高的个人武力所淹没，事实上除了刺客信条系列之外，似乎很少有游戏将单纯的海战作为游戏的主旋律，哪怕是之前爆火的《盗贼之海》也只是将海战作为游戏的一部分，其更多的是登船战或者是岛上寻宝之类的玩法。\n\n而《碧海黑帆》抛开了魔法侧的怀抱，毅然决然的走向了科技侧。而游戏中的战斗也没有任何的玄幻要素，主打一个炮炮到船的真实感，游戏中抛开船只不同的皮肤之外，在船只种类和火炮类型两方面做到了高度自由化，玩家可以自行建造船只，同时在船只上不同的位置安排火炮，根据不同的位置以及玩家的习惯来定制性的安排适合的火炮，远距离射击加成的鱼雷，近距离射击的散石炮，远距离的高射炮等等。同时还有着装甲和外设两部分代表着防御和特殊的加成能力的部分可以供玩家自定义。\n\n游戏的战斗方面其实内容并不算多，制作组将大量的内容都精简化，船身的炮火会根据玩家鼠标的瞄准方向自动选择最近的炮，升帆变成了简单的w和s控制，同时有着简单清晰的三个当位。而游戏的登船战也同样的被精简掉了，原本的接舷战变成了一个玩家炮火视角下扔绳子的斩杀玩法，播完一个过场cg就结束，而一些岛屿虽然可以上去探索，但是需要黑屏加载过场，有着一定的割裂感，相较于盗贼之海的开放度更大的玩法来说就稍显不足。\n\n游戏的任务方面相较于传统的育碧自家的罐头多了一些特殊的活动任务，但是特殊的任务依旧逃不出海战的玩法，内容性上重复度有些稍大，而游戏罐头味十足的任务则更是如此。而这也导致游戏体验过一段时间之后很难再提起兴趣去做同质化的任务，仅仅是为了游戏同质化进阶数值提升的大炮和装甲。\n\n\n优秀但是罐头味有些过重。\n评分7.5/10",

Surcar los mares con todos los peligros que acechan, asaltar a otros jugadores o bots, personalizar tanto el barco como nuestro personaje son algunas de las cosas que hacen del juego algo divertido. Gráficamente no es que sea nada del otro mundo, pero tampoco será lo peor que has visto. Está bien optimizado, al menos en mi caso (32Gb de ram, RTX2080, Ryzen 7 5800x) y jugando todo al máximo a 2K va bastante bien. No está plagado de bugs, pero hasta ahora se me ha bugeado una misión principal (asaltar un asentamiento de los Fara) únicamente.\n\nEn definitiva, si te gusta la temática pirata deberías darle una oportunidad porque aunque se echen en falta cosas como el combate cuerpo a cuerpo es un juego que se disfruta. Eso si, píllalo de oferta porque el precio original es exagerado ¡Nos vemos en la mar!",

Seriously, the cheap parallax effect with hills bouncing up and down is jarring once you notice it. Also, the ships are far too fast and nimble, they never feel like massive sail-driven ships. How they managed to go from AC:BF to this is a mystery. Most likely, this is a result of all the different directions this game was tugged over the many years it was in development, with nobody agreeing on exactly what type of game they were making. Someone clearly wanted it to be more fast-paced so corners were cut everywhere to improve performance -- the visuals suffered greatly but somehow frame rate didn't improve.\n\nStill, if you get it really cheap on sale, and you don't mind the fact that the in-game chat that didn't work during open beta STILL doesn't work after all this time*, there's still fun to be had shooting up ships. The \"empire building\" part is ridiculously hard to get into, so expect to spend a LOT of time in the mid-game plateu grinding for bettter ships and equipment. PVP is opt-in and to this day I have never seen any.\n\n*) There's a Steam achievement tied to the permanently broken in-game chat system, so 100% completion is quite impossible. You have been warned.",

At this price, it’s a decent game if you’re into naval combat and pirate-themed adventures. The ship progression and grind are reasonable, with fun ship weapons that offer different playstyles for both casual and dedicated players.\n\nHowever, don't expect anything remotely realistic from this game. The biggest issue is that it feels confused—at times you’re a pirate, at other times you’re more of a pirate ship simulator, and that lack of clarity affects the experience. The upgrade and customization systems are mostly limited, with a lot of content locked behind microtransactions, making it feel like a free-to-play game disguised as a paid one.\n\nBut if you go in without heavy expectations, Skull and Bones is a nice game to unwind with. Grab some rum, fire up your cannons, and have fun blowing up enemy ships. Forget the grind and just enjoy the chaos—that’s where the game truly shines.",

Je pravda, že jsem jí pořídil ve slevě a za plnou cenu, bych asi do ní nešel. Mám zatím odehráno něco přes 4 hodiny a proto doporučuji. Udělejte si vlastní názor a ne, jak já přebírat komentáře.",

Simply put, game was fun for the first few minutes in the initial mission, but couldn't even experience the lackluster combat some have listed in their own reviews being no swashbuckling, nor boarding other ships, or acting like a pirate beyond manning the helm - summarily put, I refunded with under 2 hours of play due to the lack of able to just play.\n\nIF I see a work around, or a concept that ubisoft released a fix or update patch, i'd likely buy again though. Seemed fun for the $20 ish spent seeing there really aren't many pirate games out there either tbh. I wouldn't purchase for full retail though.\n\nWe gamers need a solid pirate game - right? One that encompasses all aspects of pirate life imo.",

        "content": "Posted: August 26\nA NE PAS COMPARER AVEC : Sea Of Thieves !\n\nS&B c'est vraiment un jeu basé sur l'expérience maritime, il n'y a que des combats à bord de votre bateau.\nCe qui est bien c'est que le pvp est activable/désactivable, si on veut jouer en PvE only et bien c'est possible ( à savoir que les contacts entre bateaux existent encore et on peut se faire tirer dessus, mais on ne prend *aucun* dégât )\n\nLes graphismes sont incroyables ( je joue avec un pc intel 7 7700 + nvidia 1080ti ) et je n'ai absolument aucun problème d'fps ou de freeze ou quoique ce soit, là-dessus c'est vraiment propre, rien à dire ! Et les effets en mer ( attendez de voir les tempêtes !! ), une dinguerie !\n\nCertains vont se dire directement : un open world maritime c'est sûr et certain la map est vide. Et bien en fait les effets visuels + la faune/flore ajoutée + les bateaux pnj rendent la mer assez remplie en fait, il y a constamment du mouvement !\n\nJe pensais que naviguer tout le temps allait être ennuyant mais franchement ça passe vite, et puis ils ont ajouté le fait qu'après quelques minutes en mer ( et sans combat ou autre événement extérieur) les pirates commencent à chanter, ce qui crée encore plus de vie sur la map.\n\nLes combats sont vraiment bien réalisés, ils sont basés sur un système de dégâts \"normaux\" et dégâts sur des éléments \"fragiles\" du bateau ennemi ( qui dit fragile dit coup critique quand on touche ). Néanmoins ça peut vite devenir le bordel quand on attaque des \"pirates d'élites\" qui appellent du renfort, tout le monde se rentre dedans à un moment donné tellement il y a du monde au même endroit. Mais c'est fun !\n\nPar contre est-ce que le jeu vaut réellement 60€ pour le contenu qui y est présent ? A savoir qu'en bout du compte, c'est \"répétitif\" vu que c'est toujours des batailles navales. Pour répondre à la question, je ne suis pas sûr ... Par chance je l'ai eu à -60% et à ce prix perso je ne peux pas me plaindre ! Mais il est vrai que la trame de l'histoire est assez prenante et plein de missions secondaires à faire, tout cela fait qu'en réalité on ne se rend pas vraiment compte de la répétition pendant qu'on joue.\n\nDeux petits éléments négatifs pour moi c'est :\n- la distance de la cam de la 3ème personne n'est pas modifiable, sur terre ça va mais en bateau je trouve ça très perturbant, pour changer de vue on est obligé de changer d'angle sur le bateau en lui-même, pas le perso.\n- la nuit il fait beaucoup trop sombre pour bien distinguer les choses, je suis obligé de mettre mon écran en 'game mode' pour l'avoir plus clair mais alors le jeu est moche\n\nA voir si ils comptent rajouter des choses ( il semblerait que c'est prévu, la map n'est pas encore complète ) mais sincerement, le jeu est très prometteur !",
